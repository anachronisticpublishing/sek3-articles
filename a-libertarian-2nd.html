<h2>A Libertarian 2nd</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Michele Flynn Stenehjem, AN AMERICAN
FIRST: JOHN T. FLYNN AND THE AMERICA
FIRST COMMITTEE (Arlington House, New
Rochelle, NY, $8.95)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John T. Flynn was one of us.</p>
<p>I expect three reactions to that evaluation.
 First, there will be the conservative
“libertarians” and Birchers who will wonder why
that could be considered a contentious statement.
After all, did not Flynn fight the Red Conspiracy
for his last 20 years, expose “That Man In the
White House,” and support all sorts of rightist
and McCarthyite groups in the fifties? To the
radical libertarian, hardly a recommendation.</p>
<p>Second, a very few radical libertarians,
knowing of Flynn’s support for political candidates
 and of his self-silencing on the War
question after Pearl Harbor in the interest of
“national unity” will raise up their hands in
horror at the embracing of this non-“purist.”</p>
<p>Third, and by far the largest reaction I
expect, is “Who?”</p>
<p>From 1939 to 1941, the single, overriding
issue for everyone in the U.S.A. was World War 2.
Should the U.S. enter?</p>
<p>The side it should enter on was never in
question, since Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria,
and Romania were “fascist”—and hence reprehensible.
 But fascist Poland was to be valued (though
not democratic Finland). And half-fascist France,
Conservative-Socialist Britain, monarchist North
Africa, Yugoslavia and Greece, and various other
bastions of “liberal democracy” evoked the sympathy
 of the American liberal press—and saving the
British empire.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the “Great Debate”—as the War
question battle was often called—cut across the
Spectrum. Covert fascists seeing Franklin Roosevelt
 as the American Duce supported interventionism.
 Pro-German Nazis opposed entry simply because
it was on the “wrong” side. Many conservatives,
especially Southerners, were bellicose and jingoist;
 others from the North and West were isolationist.
 The big press, TIMES on both coast, TIME,
PM and LIFE were pro-war; but Hearst, McCormack
and Patterson opposed entry.</p>
<p>While New Deal “progressives” were all for
King Franklin’s Crusade, the old progressives,
such as Sen. Burton Wheeler, Philip LaFollette,
and the “other” Roosevelts, were solidly opposed.
The Communist Party U.S.A. opposed entry—until
June 1941. Then it disseminated the most blistering
 smears imaginable against its former anti-war
allies and called for Congressional witch-hunts
against the “uh-American“ anti-war movement.</p>
<p>What of libertarians? Hell, James J. Martin
was unheard of at the time, but anti-war, and Murray
 Rothbard had yet to discover anarchy, and was
an interventionist. Chodorov, Mencken and Nock
were isolationist, of course.</p>
<p>And then there were the liberals. “Liberal”
in U.S. parlance includes Social Democrats, but
Norman Thomas, later used by the CIA in the Dominican
 Republic, and perennial Socialist Party
presidential candidate, worked as an all-but-in-name
 member of Flynn’s New York Chapter of the
America First Committee (NYC-AFC). Thomas was, in
fact, involved in Flynn’s more liberal front, Keep
America Out of War Congress. Another covert supporter
 of NYC-AFC was Chester Bowles, considered
a liberal archetype by many conservatives in the
1960s. Bowles remained in the closet most of the
time because of fear of business loss (he was in
the sensitive advertising industry)—but so did
many conservatives, such as the brothers Richardson
 of Vick Chemical.</p>
<p>The heroism of Flynn, Oswald Garrison Villard,
 Charles A. Beard and classical liberals of
that ilk has been well-presented by New Left revisionist
 Ronald Radosh in his PROPHETS ON THE
RIGHT (see review in NEW LIBERTARIAN WEEKLY # 1,
11/30/75). The only new things Ms. Stenehjem has
to offer concerning her father’s purge from liberal
 media and blacklisting by Roosevelt was to
add the problems he faced from the infiltrating
Coughlinites, Bundists, Christian Frontists, and
even pro-administration provacateurs.</p>
<p>[FIXME: link to NLW?]</p>
<p>Concerning the book at hand, Ms. Stenehjem
is neither hard-core nor a great writer. But her
Subject matter is Fascinating and carries the
book. More than anything else, AN AMERICAN FIRST
is the story of an incredible series of mistakes,
martyrs, mobilizations and mixed premises. And
finally, of defeat when Roosevelt finally goaded
the Japanese into their fatalistic attack on Pearl
Harbor.</p>
<p>Most of the mistakes of the AFC can be attributed
 to their mixed premises. Not just the
problems of a wide “pop front” constricted strategy,
 but far more important, AFC limited itself
to direct pressure on Congressmen, and then to propaganda
 to the constituents of marginal legislators
to pressure their Representatives. NYC-AFC was
thankfully saved from direct entry into electoral
activity by its dissolution in December 1941. AFC
worked above all to be respectable, and eschewed
civil disobediance, sabotage, and active and passive
 resistance.</p>
<p>The anti-Viet Nam War “isolationists” used
all of the above, appealing directly to the masses—and
 won the critical point. And where the Student
 Mobilization Committee and peace groups welcomed
 Commies, Trots, and Maoists. Flynn shunned
association with Nazis and anti-Semites.</p>
<p>Only Charles Lindbergh was unafraid to say
what was common knowledge in 1941: that Jewish
organizations and Jewish-owned media were acting,
out of a mistaken ethnic solidarity and from an
unmistaken fear of threats to themselves, as
hard-core warmongers. And although Lindbergh
and Flynn hastened to point out that some Jews
recognized that the fascist threat came from the
New Deal and not the Third Reich, the pseudo-liberals
 pilloried Lindbergh for intolerance and
spattered the AFC with guilt-by-association.</p>
<p>Now to answer why the three reactions to
my embracing of Flynn are wrong. Flynn was a
liberal in the 1930s—but a “classical” one. In
fact, he came close to being a “radical minarchist”—like
 many of the modern limited government
 libertarians who have embraced the anarchist’s
radical analysis of American society while clinging
to the “minimal state” out of philosophical con-
fusion.</p>
<p>Flynn was not only pro-free market, his only
serious Statist deviation in the 1930s, while
writing “Other People’s Money.” a column for the
NEW REPUBLIC, was support of anti-trust. Rightly
he feared the corporate statists Morgan, Rockefeller.
et al; wrongly, he thought the limited state could
and should deal with them. The war issue finally
taught him that the enemy was Washington, and no
succor could be gained from that quarter against
the “triumph of conservatism“ of the Wall Street
“progressives.” Thus, almost coincidentally and
certainly fortuitously, from Dec. 1940 to Dec. 1941,
when organizer of the NYC-AFC, Flynn held an incredibly
 pure libertarian position, far more so than
any other figure in America First.</p>
<p>And he was hard-core, cheering up the flagging
spirits, resolving to push ahead during the Lend-Lease
 and convoy defeats, keeping the faithful
pleased, the group pure, and writing tirelessly to
match the pro-War media blitz article for article.</p>
<p>No, it didn’t end well. Flynn dissolved the
Committee when the bombs hit Pearl, and refused to
allow others to carry it on against a “united war
effort,” though he and Thomas did attempt to defend
 civil liberties during the War-repression. He
found only that the New Deal democratic fascists
had no use for “unity” on any terms but surrender,
and he could never sell his writings again outside
the rightist press: AMERICAN MERCURY, Devin-Adair
books, HUMAN EVENTS, a few innocuous pieces for
READER’S DIGEST. Roosevelt wanted unconditional
surrender—from the Axis and from his domestic opponents.
 If nothing else, Flynn’s martyrdom is a
valuable lesson to the modern isolationist, radical
libertarian that there is no relief from the
struggle against the State, that the price for
selling out will never cover the costs.</p>
<p>For John T. Flynn fought the only good fight
available in the bleak, unlibertarlan 1940s. And
then, at least, he was one of us.</p>
