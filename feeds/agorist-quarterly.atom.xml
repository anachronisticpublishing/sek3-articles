&lt;h4&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin III, M.S.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agorism, unfortunately, needs an introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-Economics and agorism were originally fighting concepts, forged in
what seemed to be the ever-cresting revolution of 1972–73, and which proved
to be the last wave instead. Revolutionary rhetoric or not, agorism arose in a
time and a context where slogans required extensive published analysis and
ongoing dialectic criticism with highly committed competing factions. Thus,
when the crucible of “The Sixties”[1] cooled, amongst all the garish Party pennants,
 Trashing rubbish, and exploded-Ideology ashes lay a hard, bright, and
accurate theory and methodology. Probably the first economically-sound basis
for a revolutionary platform, agorism’s market melted away before it could even
get on the display rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins of Agorism: Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Berlin Wall was prefigured twenty years earlier by the
collapse of statist economics, particularly Orthodox Marxism and liberal
Keynsianism. With our release from those reigning dead economists, alternatives
 flourished from heretical “anarcho”-capitalism to deviationist Marxism —
the more heretical .and deviationist, the better. Thanks to the tireless efforts of
Murray Rothbard, paleoconservative (Old Right) class theory and isolationism
was grafted onto (or synthesized with) a free-market economics that was so
pure it generated the same systemic shock as, say, modern Christianity discovering
 original, primitive Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian School economics, particularly Ludwig von Mises’ uncompromising
praxeology[2], was, most appealingly, &lt;em&gt;uncompromising.&lt;/em&gt; Furthermore, it required
no patch-up or cover-up failures; in fact, in 1973–74, it successfully predicted
the gold boom and the subsequent stagflation which so confounded the Official
Court Economists. Mises died at his moment of triumph: Moses, Christ and
Marx to the libertarian movement rising out of the ashes of the New Left and its
dialectic opponent, the student Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray Rothbard was the Gabriel, St. Paul, and Lenin. Rather than watering
down praxeology to gain establishment acceptance and Nobel Prizes (as did
Wilhelm R6pke and Friedrich Hayek, to name two), Rothbard insisted on
radicalizing Austrianism still further.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mises, though adored by radical rightists from Ayn Rand to Robert Welch,
died calling himself a Liberal, though a 19th century Hapsburg Austrian Liberal,
 to be sure. Rothbard, with his academic historian allies Leonard Liggio and
Joseph Peden, insisted that Austrianism went beyond the tepid classical liberalism
 being revived by the Milton Friedmans; it demanded not merely limited,
constitutional, republican government — it required none at all.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could Röpke counsel Christian Democrat &lt;em&gt;Kanzler&lt;/em&gt; Konrad Adenauer
and Birchers love Mises when Rothbard preached outright anarchy? The answer
 lay in praxeology’s crucial concept of &lt;em&gt;wertfrei&lt;/em&gt; — value free. As many
critics later pointed out — even friendly, libertarian ones — economics assumed
 some values at various levels, such as to take the most blatant example,
the value of economic study itself. Nevertheless, suppressing conscious valuation
 allowed Mises to make a far more penetrating analysis devastating to all
political illusionists of his time — but also allowed his theory to be sold in
amputated parcels by selective opportunists and bought by well-meaning but
narrow-focused activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true meaning of Misesian “Austrian Economics” continues to be hotly
debated in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Austrian Economics,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Critical Review,&lt;/em&gt; and libertarian
movement journals, but what concerns us here is what it was perceived as being
at the founding of Counter-Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origin of Agorism: Counter-Economics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian economics answered questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Why do we value and how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ It is inherent in everyone and it is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Why do we give up anything at all ever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Because we subjectively value A more than B while some Other values B
more than A. We do not relinquish; we acquire a greater value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• But why would anyone give up something that is &lt;em&gt;universally&lt;/em&gt; (or as close as
possible) subjectively valued for something of less value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Because that one-thousandth unit of the seemingly more valuable is less
subjectively valuable than the first unit of the seemingly lesser. Who would
consider it folly to trade one’s hundredth loaf of bread for a first diamond?
Utility is marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Why do we have money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Facilitate trade, keep quantitative accounts, make change and store value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• From where does money come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ It arises from commodities exchanged more and more as a middle or
medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Can government improve on money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ No, it is strictly a market function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;What is the result of government intervention anywhere in the market?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Government is force, however legitimized and accepted; all force prevents
subjective value satisfaction, that is, whatever human actors voluntarily give up
and accept is by their personal subjective (and unknowable to others) understanding,
 the best informed outcome to them. Any violence that deters their
exchange is counter-productive to all the exchanges and to those whose exchanges
 depend on theirs — that is, violent intervention is a &lt;em&gt;universal disutility&lt;/em&gt;
in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mises thus concludes that all coercion — and that includes government
action — is not just anti-market but &lt;em&gt;inhumane.&lt;/em&gt; Not bad for value-free assumptions!
 Röpke (author of &lt;em&gt;Humane Economy&lt;/em&gt;), Hayek, and even Mises felt that
once private force or that of another state entered the marketplace, government
counter-force was justified for rectification. Furthermore, none could conceive
of any other way to deal with human protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Murray Rothbard. . .and Robert LeFevre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins of Agorism: Anti-Politics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1964 and 1974, the entire political spectrum save for a sliver of
“liberal” machines in the Democratic and Republican parties were intensely
alienated from politics. The moderate Left had their hopes dashed by Kennedy’s
assassination and looked further Left; the moderate Right pinned their hopes
on Goldwater and were driven out of politics by the establishment-medium
distortions and misrepresentations of his — their — positions. Some turned on,
tuned in, and dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of us pursued what Europeans call so diplomatically extra-parliamentary
 politics. Rothbard and his “East Coast” libertarians pursued an alliance
of alienated “Old Right” and “New Left” for a classical revolution. Robert
LeFevre and his “West Coast” libertarians pursued a civil-disobedience stance:
non-participation in state-sanctioned politics, particularly elections and office-holding,
 coupled with education and activism to expand refusal until the State
could no longer function. By 1969, the Weatherman tactic of exacerbating State
violence with its own to accelerate revolution drove Rothbard to give up his
Ultra Left-Right coalition dream, and support peace candidates. LeFevre remained
 anti-collaborationist until his death in 1986, but civil disobedience and
pacifism went out of fashion in the mid-19705.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins of Agorism: Counter-Economics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when agorism appeared, there were several questions to be dealt with
beyond the answers of then-current Austrian Economics and libertarian politics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Can the State be &lt;em&gt;praxeologically&lt;/em&gt; dispensed with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Answering that affirmatively, as both Rothbard and LeFevre and several
others did...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard and Ernestine Perkins,[5] Morris and Linda Tannehill[6], and David
Friedman[7] and the many contributors to &lt;em&gt;The Libertarian Connection&lt;/em&gt;[8] gave early
answers as to how the market could provide protection agencies which would
be competitive — eliminating the problem of the inherent coercion of the State.
Unable to regulate or tax, able to act only when paid for and asked to protect or
reclaim property, the agency solved the problem of intervention against subjective-valuing
 human actors. Arbitration would replace magistration for justice
— or at least settling rival claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of them describe the &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt; of getting from here (statism) to there
(stateless marketplace or agora). Assuming market entrepreneurs would find a
way, the strategy for achieving liberty was left as an exercise for the readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same 1972 US Presidential election where the power élite did to
George McGovern and the non-revolutionary anti-war left what they had done
to Barry Goldwater, a new party emerged. Although the Libertarian Party
received a minuscule percentage of the vote and was ignored by everyone from
Rothbard to LeFevre, a rebel elector in Virginia bolted Nixon’s overwhelming
majority to putjohn Hospers and the LP on the political map. It turned out to
be the high point of the LP’s success, but with the Fran Youngstein for Mayor
Campaign in 1973, conservative and radical libertarians mingled and then
repolarized. The crucial debate of 1974 was no longer anarchy &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; minarchy, but
partyarchy &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; agorism.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-party majority argued that working within the political system had
failed for two centuries. The new “party anarchists” or &lt;em&gt;partyarchs&lt;/em&gt; argued that
nothing else had worked (everything else presumably had been tried in the
Sixties). At least they had a strategy. Furthermore, it could be perceived to work
in stages and even increments as a law was repealed here or a tax there. Of
course, in the twenty years of the LP’s existence, no “retreat of statism” has been
noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-party libertarians were forced to choose between yet another paradigm
 shift to respond (remember, most had been radicalized from conservatism
to near Weathermen) or give up. Those who remained in the fight with their
new analysis and corresponding strategy took the name of the market to oppose
themselves to political parties and statism — &lt;em&gt;agora.&lt;/em&gt; The new paradigm of the
agorist was called (in tribute to the then-fading Counter-Culture) Counter-Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-Economics is the study and practice of the human action in the
Counter-Economy. The Counter-Economy is all human action not sanctioned
by the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Quantum Mechanics arose by theoretical chemists and physicists
refusing to ignore the paradigm-breaking experiments, and Relativity arose
from Einstein’s acceptance of the Michelson-Morley results, Counter-Economics
 arose as a theory by taking into account what all standard economics either
ignored or downplayed. Just as light tunneled out of Hawking’s black holes,
human action tunneled under the control of the state. And this underground
economy, black market, &lt;em&gt;nalevo&lt;/em&gt; Russia turned out to be far, far too vast to ignore
as a minor correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earliest agorist-influenced science-fiction in 1975, the story[10] predicted
 the USSR would fall to counter-economic forces by 1990 and soon
thereafter turn into such a free-market paradise that it would be invaded by the
statist world lead by the imperialist US. (as this article is being written, the last
of that prophecy comes to pass).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Counter-Economic alternative gave the agorists a devastating weapon.
Rather than slowly amass votes until some critical mass would allow state
retreat (if the new statists did not change sides to protect their new vested
interests), one could commit civil disobedience profitably, dodging taxes and
regulations, having lower costs and (potentially) greater efficiency than one’s
statist competitors — if any. For many goods and services could only arise or be
provided counter-economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the New Libertarian Alliance left their campuses and aboveground
“white market” jobs and went full-time counter-economic for a decade to prove
the strategy’s viability. In 1980, the long-delayed &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; was
issued to those into party politics or other forms of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Agorism Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly little systematic research had been done in counter-economics
since the agorist discovery a decade after the immersion of the agorist cadre.
They surfaced to find a changed political landscape. It had been expected that
their more-timid allies would stay aboveground to conduct officially-sanctioned
 research, but that failed to happen for now-obvious institutional reasons.
 Hence, determined to report their findings, take advantage of freedom of
the press and academic freedom to do so, and, incidentally, raise families, the
publishing cadre formed The Agorist Institute in the libertarian-rich American
Southwest at the end (symbolically) of 1984. The rest of the history of agorism
is the history of The Agorist Institute’s trials and tribulations (which will
presumably be published someday). AI flourished at the end of the 19805,
hitting its nadir as counter-economics — if not full agorism — swept the globe
and tossed socialism into the dustbin of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future of Agorism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the Counter-Economy itself, agorists had a problem with market
feedback operating aboveground, especially in the almost-market-devoid realm
of tax-deductible, educational foundations — a fund-devouring unreality forbidding
 enough to consume a fat chunk of the Koch family fortune and spit out
Charles and David. Although receiving some financial support from mid-range
successful entrepreneurs, AI attempted to do it all: research support, classes,
seminars, academic conferences and publication of journals and newsletters
(internal and external). (All the staff had additional jobs or businesses to
support themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the 1995 revival also marks the AI’s tenth anniversary and the long-awaited
 and delayed publication of this quarterly. Once again, we embark on
studying the vast iceberg below the tip — the Counter-Economy — and report
our findings. To avoid our previous pitfalls, AI is focusing on three self-supporting
 (in short order) publications: &lt;em&gt;AQ,&lt;/em&gt; the already-appearing but infrequent
 &lt;em&gt;New Isolationist,&lt;/em&gt; and new moment-by-moment newsletter of the primary
concern, &lt;em&gt;Counter-Economics.&lt;/em&gt; The test or preview issue, #0, follows this journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has changed in a second decade — but, strangely enough, the
Russian &lt;em&gt;nalevo&lt;/em&gt; market is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; there to study after the Second Revolution — only
this time, we will not be able to rely on CIA-sponsored published accounts[11].
How will the European Counter-Economy, particularly the Black Labor market,
 fare with the dropping of borders? What about Canada’s and Mexico’s
“informal” economies with the passage of NAFTA? Is Hernando de Soto’s &lt;em&gt;El
Otro Sendero&lt;/em&gt; going to win over Abimael Guzman’s &lt;em&gt;Sendero Luminoso,&lt;/em&gt; especially
after betrayal by de Soto’s alleged political (partyarch) disciples, Mario Vargas
Llosa and then Alberto Fujimori? Recently, the former &lt;em&gt;Comandate Cero&lt;/em&gt; of the
&lt;em&gt;Tercerista&lt;/em&gt; (uncompromising) faction of the Sandanistas, Eden Pastora, chose
the agorist Karl Hess Club to announce his candidacy for President of Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the United States? How does all the above affect America’s
counter-economic foreign interface [academic for “the smuggling industry”]?
What effect will Clinton’s State medicine do to the health-providing service?
Will all medical treatment end up like 19505 abortion, and will people grab free
needles at the AIDS-prevention center to give to their black doctors for unauthorized
 immunization of their children who cannot wait their “turn” (due after
their scheduled death, as in Canada and England)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every issue in today’s press from Bosnia to Oklahoma City has an overlooked
Counter-Economic component that AI can explore, compile and publish. Other
areas can be excavated from the underground that will &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; issues once
exposed and explained, and then there is the new battleground for agorists and
statists: cyberspace, where cypherpunk agorist road warriors have an early lead
over the Gore statist superhighwaymen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, finally and overall, the issue needing the most immediate attention is
that of agorism itself. To the extent that it is “agorology” and not just ideology,
what is and should be its methodology? We most urgently invite our newly
awakened and empowered students of agorism and multi-disciplinarians of
counter-economics to contribute their first — and second — thoughts on the
subject. Are some methods out of bounds in agorism that are academically
acceptable, for example? Or are some methods acceptable in counter-economic
study that are unacceptable to academic researchers? Can we be &lt;em&gt;wertfrei&lt;/em&gt; when
we are obviously attracted to the Black as Departments of Marxist Studies are to
the Red? Should there be &lt;em&gt;competing&lt;/em&gt; methodologies? (In case there was the least
doubt, AI encourages one, two, many agorist foundations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about that new Power Mac equipment to hook up to the Video
Toaster? Is traditional publishing enough or should it be supplemented — or
supplanted — by full-scale video production passed along by Videotape — or
hurtled through the Internet like “Breaker, breaker” trucks on the information
superhighway? Should AQ continue to appear on paper, or in .PDF on-line files
as &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine is now doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is “Rightist” Militia instead of New Left cadre blowing up federal
buildings and protesting massacres of peaceful women and children, but fighting
for freedom against the American Empire is turning serious again. In an
important way, our Nineties are like the Sixties: we don’t know where we’re
going to end up, but we know we’re on our way. Or, in 90s’ parlance, as our
children’s spokesperson would say, when asked about “the future,” agorists
answer, “The Future? We’re &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...by which &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; mean November 1963 to August 1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, especially. &lt;em&gt;Human Action&lt;/em&gt; in any of its numerous editions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power and Market,&lt;/em&gt; his “completion” of &lt;em&gt;Man, Economy and State&lt;/em&gt; (which itself was a rewrite of
&lt;em&gt;Human Action)&lt;/em&gt; had just come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, as I reflected back to Murray around 1971, “You mean, we’re not classical Liberals,
we’re classical Radicals!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work is long out of print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Market for Liberty&lt;/em&gt; (1970) was reprinted by Fox &amp;amp; Wilkes (of Center for Independent
Thought which runs Laissez Faire Books) in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Machinery of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; has been both reprinted and revised. Naturally, it is the least hard-core
 of the three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An “APA,” or amateur press association based on the science-fiction fanzine concept collating
 several contributors publications without editing, it has survived since 1970 with one of
the original overall “editors” still active in it, Erwin “Filthy Pierre” Strauss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The November 1972 issue of &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt; cover story was a debate between LP
Founder David Nolan and anti-party “radical caucus” [always lower cased] founder Samuel
Edward Konkin III. By 1974, several State party newsletters contained debate and discussion
on the party’s consistency with principle. Those editors who did not defect to the New
Libertarian Alliance were all purged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Agent for Anarchy” (1971) the first Rann Gold story, preceded agorism, but the sequels,
“The Statesman” (1973) and “Dragon’s Bane” (1975), were progressively more influenced by
it, and the background history was not set until the third. All were published in &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt; and its successor, &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Weekly.&lt;/em&gt; Since those early attempts to fill
the demand for hard-core libertarian science-fiction, the Market took an invisible hand, and
Neil Schulman, Victor Koman, L. Neil Smith, Brad Linaweaver and many others actually
found aboveground publishers to pay them for the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some excellent studies were done by Dmitri Simes and his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coming Issues:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next issue, we are calling for articles on the impact of the late Murray
Rothbard (our Founding Advisor) on the Libertarian Movement, stressing his
intellectual contributions. Two obvious examples: his original synthesis of
Austrian market economics with anarchist politics; his refusal to follow most
free-market advocates into mobilization for the Cold War. (For personal tributes
 and discussion of Post-Rothbard Libertarian activism will find it in &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine, PO. Box 1748, Long Beach, CA 90801-1748.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up a working methodology to get our research going, editor
SEK3 exhumes the recently-deceased corpse of Marxism-Leninism and continues
 his series &lt;em&gt;Agorism&lt;/em&gt; Contra &lt;em&gt;Marxism&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;AQ3&lt;/em&gt; has the title, “Now What’s &lt;em&gt;Left&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;From Mises to Marx&lt;/em&gt; by David Ramsay Steel reviewed. Why “libertarianism”
failed in gravedigging Marxism-Leninism — and Agorism succeeded... And
why Chicago School-collaborator “libertarians” frantically denigrate the triumphant
 Austrian praxeologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• ...and reviews and articles not vetted, not to mention those not submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Agorist Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; encourages Letters to the Editor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="agorism"></category><category term="theory"></category><category term="history"></category></entry><entry><title>This Movement of His: Murray N.

Rothbard, 1926–1995&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;By Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In person, Murray Rothbard could be described as a Woody Allen who
had studied economics; it was no accident that one of his all-time favourite
directors was Mel Brooks. When confronted with accusations that former
conservatives had become so ideological as libertarians that they were
turning into humorless movement cogs, one had only to offer in rebuttal
the contrast of Murray with Marx, Lenin, and, for that matter, Rand. Even
the Conservative who purged him from &lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt; in the 1950s for
high deviations (refusal to sanction the State for anti-Communist crusading),
 William F. Buckley, had to refer to his victims as “Murray Rothbard
and his Merry Band of Anarchists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This personality stability and good humor have profound consequences
for what he, oft described as the Godfather of the modern Libertarian
Movement, called “This Movement of Ours.” First and foremost, it meant
that no matter how much one disagreed with him, one was not cast into
outer darkness (again, unlike Marx, Lenin, and Rand) never to be mentioned
 again. In 1977, at our most estranged over the Libertarian Party, I
described him as Darth Vader in print. Three years later he was purged
from the mighty Kochtopus by the device of taking away his token shares
in the Cato Institute, which evoked his loudest cries of betrayal. I promptly
sent him shares in &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine with the caveat that they
could not be taken away from him under any circumstances. He responded
 immediately with customary wit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothbard’s impact on libertarian (and agorist) intellectual and ideological
 development will easily fill our entire next number of &lt;em&gt;AQ;&lt;/em&gt; personal
tributes and discussion of his movement impact and the Post-Rothbard
future, if any, of the Libertarian Movement will take up at least one, if not
more, issues of &lt;em&gt;NL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two points need to be made immediately: there would be no Libertarian
Movement save for the thought and action (particularly in the 1960s) of
Professor Murray Newton Rothbard, Ph.D., and, had he pursued the same
sort of tactics he had experienced in his association with fellow students at
Columbia, or with the Randists or the ex-Communist purgers around
Buckley, the Movement that we know today would not have endured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one who finds himself more and more belonging to another, different
 movement of the future, I offer to all Movements, present and future,
the example of one who disdained to retain his leadership by any means
save superiority in intellectual combat and possession of sharper wit. I
