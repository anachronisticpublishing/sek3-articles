&lt;h3&gt;Or: The case against repeal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;By Samuel Edward Konkin, III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pick an anti, any anti.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be considered the libertarian equivalent of a
card trick. In sleight-of-hand, the object is to have the member
 of the audience choose the card you want him to, while
letting him choose whatever he wants. The libertarian trying
 to conjure up a convert—or at least a little attention—can
 load his deck in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the trick? The stage magician wants you to select
a card, any card—but from his deck. And the adept libertarian
 asks the same: select an “anti” position from the
Deck of Political Issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the “member of the audience” says he’s anti-tomato
 soup, or anti-brushing one’s teeth four times a day,
the libertarian just shrugs and says, “Laissez faire!”
Then you remind the mark that he was supposed to pick a
card from the deck, select an “anti” from political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-busing? Even the most retarded libertarian could
demonstrate that the State is responsible for busing to
atone for the sins of segregation visited upon the seventh
generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-gun? Well, this may bother some gun nut libertarians,
 but the trick, I assure you, always works. If the
rube throws you a curve, reverse your stance to catch it.
Try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sure you’ll agree we can’t get rid of all guns by
force. After all, who will get rid of the guns held by those
who are forcing everyone else to hold them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But actually, there are indeed far more guns than
people would freely produce if they had their way. And you
know who has the most guns—to be used for offensive as
well as defensive purposes—not to mention gas, planes,
neutron bombs, killer lasers, missiles, tanks and on and
on?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the audience is once again facing the
State as the obstacle to the satisfaction of their anti-ness.
The same “reverse stance” can be used whether you’re
given anti-sexism or anti-feminism, anti-pollution or anti-ecology,
 anti-war or anti-(reason for the war).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-tax? You should be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I’m really that good a libertarian magician, I
should be able to foil my own trick. Suppose I enter a parlor
where some alleged libertarian, having only read the first
half of this article, is wowing the guests with my ploy. He’s
a deviationist of some kind, so assume I am annoyed. He
decides to rub it in by looking at me, asking me to fall for
my gambit. “Pick an anti, any . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anti-repeal. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than likely, this deviationist is an anarcho-democrat
 (polite term for political-process libertarians ranging
from cuddly Roycians to fire-breathing Partyarchs). If there
is one thing every anarcho-democrat believes, one common
denominator for any libertarian who’s the least bit soft-core
on politics, it is support of repeal. Repeal of laws, repeal of
taxes, repeal of regulations, repeal of office (impeachment)—what
 libertarian could be against that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe this person has read two-thirds of the way
through this article and was expecting this. Suppose,
fiendishly, he throws it, back at me, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Say, aren’t you the guy who came up with this trick?
Yeah, that’s right. OK, why don’t you show us all how to
answer it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, a good libertarian magician should be able to
foil his own trick. A great libertarian wizard should be able
to counter the foil when used on him. So I’d answer thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘To repeal’ means ‘to enact legislation withdrawing or
nullifying other legislation.’ That is, the supporters of a repeal
 divide into two groups: those who gain by further political
 processing, and those who just want to get another law
off their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But many, if not most, laws are perceived to affect only
a small interest group in a statist society; hence, in order to
use the political process to get the law in question off their
backs, the latter group must devote resources to persuade
the less concerned to bestir themselves. The former group—politicians
 and their jackals—profit by allocating the resources
 and consuming much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The alternative is for the latter group (victims is a good
name) to devote whatever resources they have for the
struggle to protect or defend themselves while they are ignoring
 the law. Suddenly, the equation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the dead weight of the unconcerned has to be
stirred to gain resources and consent to crack down on the
law-abolitionists (counter-economists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Finally, a coalition of repeal groups, seeking repeals of
various laws, find it difficult to see the common enemy (the
State) and rather see themselves competing for the same
people, same money, same time for their particular repeal.
In stark contrast, every counter-economist is in solidarity
with every other. ‘The Man’ is enemy of the smuggler,
prostitute, dealer and street gambler alike. To fink is the ultimate
 crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Repeal, then, perpetuates the State, and even where it
passes, it leaves 99 and 44/100 of the oppression and
plunder. The direct action of counter-economics consumes
capital only for the specific purpose desired, and can never
be used to sustain the State. Every counter-economic act
takes from the taxman and regulator, and snubs noses at
their authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And that’s why libertarian are anti-repeal as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s how the trick is done. Some may call it sorcery;
 I call it consistency. For an anti? Why, you’re libertarian!
 Presto!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="theory"></category></entry><entry><title>Corporativism Revivus</title><link href="http://www.sek3.net/corporativism-revivus.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1977-12-01:corporativism-revivus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Sam Konkin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporativism Revivus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do Rollerball and Network,
the Seven Sisters and Rupert Murdoch,
Ayn Rand, Robert LeFevre, Sy Leon and
&lt;em&gt;Libertarian Connection&lt;/em&gt; have in common?
All are indicators of a malaise in the
present libertarian movement which
could very well save the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, at the tail end of the
old Rothbardianism, the libertarian
movement was overwhelmed by anti-corporation
 revisionism. Gabriel Kolko, for
his &lt;em&gt;Triumph of Conservatism,&lt;/em&gt; became as
recommended as Rand, Rothbard and
Mises to newcomers. Rothbard urged us
to read G. Wiliam Domhoff’s &lt;em&gt;The Higher
 Circles&lt;/em&gt; to study how the rich ran the
State for their own corporate—as opposed
 to free market—interests:
plutocracy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 1972, the New Left
was dead (Murray said so), McGovern
was a bigger threat than Nixon (Murray
spake again), and the Radical Libertarian
 Alliance, which had thundered against
 the plutocrats and vigilantly
sought out any taint of collaboration by
libertarians with “State Capitalists”,
had been transformed into “Young Republicans
 for Proxmire” and the “Citizens
 for a Restructured Republic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, &lt;em&gt;Reason,&lt;/em&gt; five years behind
the rest of the Movement, is only now
dealing with revisionist history. But this
time, it may indeed be time to revive the
anti-corporate crusade among libertarians,
 if for only two reasons: the position
is correct, and the time is right. Let me
back up both points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last fall, I assumed that the corporation’s
 relationship to the State was
well understood by most libertarians.
Then I heard a talk at the Libertarian
Supper Club of Los Angeles by James
Carbone, a scientist and neo-Galambosian,
 now on the First Libertarian
Church’s board of directors. Carbone’s
altitude toward corporations, in which he
was hip-deep as a scientific research director,
 was naive but honestly inquiring.
 What did the rest of us libertarians
think of corporations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my utter surprise and dismay,
Robert LeFevre and Seymour Leon, two
West Coast big guns of hard-core libertarianism,
 actually defended the corporate
 concept. When Neil Schulman
and I offered the beginnings of the Old
Rothbardian (or Radical Libertarian)
analysis, we met incredulity and resistance
 from the majority of the audience—an
 audience of mostly jaded, “heard-it-all”
 Movement types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing we could finally agree on as
a starting point is that the incorporation
and limited liability should not be enforced
 by law—but LeFevre, Leon and
others actually believe that the fiction of
“corporate responsibility” replacing individual
 responsibility would be voluntarily
 accepted in a free market. (I can’t
wait until we tackle the “fractional reserve”
 question for banks!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations are not a creation of the
marketplace. Corporations are not
joint-stock companies. Corporations are
not dodges around State regulations.
The only truth in all these myths is that
many otherwise free market businessmen
 accept incorporation rather than
counter-economic techniques—collaboration
 rather than resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint-stock company (which is a perfectly
 free market institution) becomes a
corporation only through the agency of
the State. First of all, the State declares
(against the plain truth to everyone’s
eves) that a scrap of paper (charter) has
created a new individual where none was
born of woman (or man). But this individual
 is not only without flesh, it is limited
 in responsibility—it is privileged
(that is what the word means)—as in a
grant from a king. And, of course,
charters from kings were the means by
which corporations first came about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate shield absorbs all responsibilities—like
 pollution damage to
crops, nonpayment of debts, or defaults,
and so on—right up to disintegration
(bankruptcy). And still, the real human
beings behind the fiction are scot-free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for theory—how has it
worked out in practice? Well. I’ll be
damned if I’m going to repeat Kolko,
Domhoff, C. Wright Mills, et al again.
So read the originals, or dig through
your back numbers of libertarian magazines
 to read the reviews. And take a
look at James J. Martin, a libertarian of
impeccable credentials (for example,
&lt;em&gt;Revisionist Viewpoints&lt;/em&gt;), and acid Carl
Oglesby’s latest masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;The Yankee
 and Cowboy War.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States’ central State is
controlled by a small group of men and
women—the Higher Circles, the Power
Elite, the “conspiracy”—who intermarry
 in a social strata, attend the same social
 functions and belong to the same
clubs, constitute the membership of the
major policy-making organizations:
Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral
Commission, Committee for Economic
Development, Bilderbergers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want names? David Rockefeller and
his academic friends Henry Kissinger
and Zbigniew Brzezinski (yes, “and”),
Prince Bernhard (until recently) of the
Netherlands and of Royal Dutch Shell,
Robert Anderson of ARCO, the Lazard
Freres and other Rothschild interest controllers,
 the major names of the J.P.
Morgan interests, the Kennedys, the
DuPonts, Mellons, Pews, Sulzbergers,
Sehifts, the other Rockefellers, Vances,
Helms, Sorensons, and so on. (See
New Libertarian Notes #28. “Introduction
 to Libertarian Ruling Class Theory”
by this author.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[FIXME: link to NLN]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate interests have been divided
 up along sectional lines, and according
 to degrees of entrenchment,
since the founding of the American
State (and even over the founding—see
Charles Beard’s Economic Interpretations
 of the Constitution). The Morgans
and Rockefellers fought over whether
there should be a World War I and
joined together for World War II. Then
came the nouveau riche, or should I say
nouveaux etatistes, from the West:
William Randolph Hearst, Howard
Hughes, the movie moguls, the computer
 entrepreneurs and the aerospace industries,
 The Cowboy and Yankee war
over Korea, Vietnam, Kennedy, Watergate,
 Nixon . . . here we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hearst, Hughes and Getty are
dead: surely the Cowboys ride no more.
Ah, but look past the American frontier,
to western Canada, Alaska . . . and Australia.
 And sure enough, in rides Rupert
 Murdoch. The British establishment
calls for Anderson of ARCO to save the
venerable Observer from the parvenue
publisher, but that’s alright, he’s already
 got half the tabloid market in
London. And on to San Antonio, Texas,
and then to New York...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, that’s Yankee country,
their home! Murdoch buys up the New
York Post from ailing Dolly Schiff, and
then moves on New York and The Village
Voice. The Yankees intellectual sycophants
 run around like chickens with a
lox loose in the henhouse or a college of
cardinals who find that a Protestant has
just bought the Vatican—but to no avail,
NYM Co. falls and another inter-corporate
 struggle has begun. Who knows
what politicians may be assassinated or
Watergated this time? (Murdoch supported
 Carter, so it’s Morgan Yankees
and Texas Cowboys plus Murdoch vs
Rockefeller Yankees and Sun-Belt Cowboys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we could talk about the
USSR, Inc., the world’s most self-contained
 corporation, though not the richest
 or even the biggest. Yet the Soviet
Union acts just like a company with a
very big plant and facilities (and cheap
labor force), and owns huge blocks of
shares in many Western European,
Asian and even American companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget the Seven Sisters:
these are the seven oil companies that
OPEC must sell to. There are Rothschild’s
 Royal Dutch Shell; British Petroleum:
 Texaco; Gulf; and three Rockefeller
 companies (Standard Oil before
the breakup): Exxon, Mobil, and Standard
 of California. Needless to say,
bank transactions of petrodollars go
through Chase Manhattan (David Rockefeller)
 Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough. Can no one see this? How do
we get the message through to the
masses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too late—they’ve already got the message.
 While libertarians have been clinging
 to Rand’s competent capitalist idol,
or following those “hippies of the right”
like &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Connection&lt;/em&gt;’s Skye
D’Aureous and Natalee Hall into grooving
 on the multi-national companies becoming
 too much for the national States
to handle, and others mentioned earlier
don’t even realize the problem, Hollywood
 has put out two excellent movies
portraying the possibility of the Corporation
 finally absorbing the State whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rollerball&lt;/em&gt; in 1975 showed the dystopia
starkly, with a hero who resembles liberty
 and individualism and single-handedly
 fights the enemy to a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 1976 gave us &lt;em&gt;Network.&lt;/em&gt;
Besides having excellent satire on television
 and presenting the best mass-media
 portrait of a Marxist (black and female,
 no less) I’ve ever seen, the movie
spells out the corporativist philosophy
starkly in the mouth of the head of the
network’s parent corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message is “the present forms of
government just get in the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may dawn on you at this point what
I’m getting at, and you may indeed
flinch. Would any Libertarian Party candidate
 (or half the non-party libertarians,
for that matter) not hail the replacement
of the present world States with multi-national
 corporations, thus making “libertarianism”
 the co-opt for a New Statism,
 the way “liberalism” was a century ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a way out of this mess. Counter-economics
 cannot be co-opted. Moscow
 may be ready for Rollerball—but
it’s got the world’s biggest black market—and
 black market mentality in its
people (with the possible exception of
Burma). What if the corporations could
not enforce their monopolies because of
smugglers? What if the plutocrats could
not regulate because everyone was avoiding,
 evading or breaking regulations?
 What if the corporations watched
their limited liability, privileged market
shrivel up as business moved to an honest,
 righteous and enthusiastic underground
 market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, what if the enforcers—whether
 UN police, National Guard or
Company agents—going out after the
culprits, came back with stories of how
&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is counter-economic—or maybe
 they didn’t come back at all . . .&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="theory"></category></entry><entry><title>Separatism and Quebec</title><link href="http://www.sek3.net/separatism-and-quebec.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1976-12-01:separatism-and-quebec.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Samuel E. Konkin, 3rd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Separatism and Quebec&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose, just across the state line from
where you live, secessionists had won an election
 taking over the local government. What would
your natural reaction be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you’re a radical libertarian, you’d
probably jump in the air with a whoop! Then after
a fast jig over the imagined grave of the Federal
State, you’d call up all your anarchofriends and
tell them the good news. And then, I hope, you’d
try to find any local libertarians in the area
struggling for freedom, offer them whatever help
you could in pushing their cause on your side of
the line, and send them what you can spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how come it didn’t happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quebec is right across the border from New
York state. New York has from 1,000 to 20,000
libertarians, depending on the degree of activism
required for definition. True, most are at the
other end of the state from the province, but
for about $15 a bus ride or an afternoon’s drive,
one could get from New York City to Montréal. Yet
if there is a single libertarian in New York who
is involved with the Québec Separatist movement
beyond reading the recent election results in the
TIMES, your friendly neighborhood anarchocolumnist
has yet to hear of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not so coincidentally, the Libertarian
Party’s dead hand lies heavier on the New York movement
 than anywhere else. And probably the most any
member thought of was that since the Separatists won
the election, well, what more is there to do? After
all, who can see beyond voting a Party into power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all the rest of you libertarian revolutionaries-in-embryo
 out there may not be all that
much better. How many of you have heard that the
separatists’ Parti Québec is socialist? You can
put your hands down now. How many of you have
heard of the Parti Québec? How many of you can
see no relevance to the Péquiste (as the P.Q. members
are usually called) victory on Nov. 15 to your libertarian
 goals whatsoever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with that and work backwards. The
breaking up of a State—even just splitting it in
two—is a net gain for those who wish to see the
State abolished or even limited. After all, libertarians
 have supported secessionism since Lysander
Spooner. Even partyarchs support secessionism (in
their Platforms or other such Holy Writ). Rothbard
has written reams on national self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a Counter-Economic view, just think of the
possibilities for smuggling, monetary speculations,
tax avoidance and regulation-evasion across three
borders rather than just one (Quebec-Canada. Canada-U.S.,
 U.S.-Quebec)! And the three borders would
meet at a point in the St. Lawrence River—right next
to New York state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely this is a tremendous gain for the rational
 self-interest of every libertarian in North
America. And possibly around the world, for think
of what a shining example the Québecois—right up
against the center of world imperialism—would be to
the Welsh, the Biharans, the Basques, the Meos, the
Slovaks and Ruthenians, the Ukrainians, the Parsia,
and on and on in nearly every country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine, as socialism managed to tie itself to
wars of “national” liberation, libertarianism was the
foundation of the struggles of minority separatist
movements around the globe. Think of Juan Carlos of
Spain denouncing the subversive influence of the Rothbardeneros;
 picture movie and TV clips of hard-eyed,
uniformed guerrillas in the jungles taking their lessons
 in classical Mises and clutching their little
black books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential is, at least by now, obvious. Can
one get in touch with the Pequistes? What are they,
anyways, and how can we deal with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for the summer in Ottawa in 1967, I ob-
served a by-election across the river in Hull, Québec,
where the Ralliement Creditiste was running a strong
race against the Progressive Conservatives and the
Liberals (the socialists have no support in Québec;
they have yet to elect a single member to either federal
 or provincial legislature). Being still a proto-libertarian,
 I was a campus chairman of the University
of Alberta Social Credit Party, so I thought I’d drop
down to RC campaign headquarters and offer to assist
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the local Créditistes flattered at being
noticed, amused at my attempts to converse about our
common ideology in French; they gave me a few leaflets
to pass around and some literature. In short, they
don’t bite; they are not hard to get in touch with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the average American libertarian can restrain himself
 from remarks like “How much is that in real money?“
or “Can you speak white?” or “Sure is picturesque up
here in Kew-Beck; guess I don’t need my parka in July“,
he can probably communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously we will be in demand. The reason is
simple: the war of secession (cold or hot) will be
fought—not in Québec, or at least no longer there
being the decisive battleground—but in Central Canada
 and the United States. If the federal government
can be hamstrung by pro-Quebec and anti-interventionist
activists in the rest of Canada, maybe even sympathetic
groups starting out to Split Alberta and British Columbia
 off in the far west, Québec can win. And there is
always the threat of the Marines landing in Montréal.
(Don’t laugh; Canadians take that possibility very
seriously, and all that is needed to exert pressure on
the Péquistes is the &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; that such action may be
taken: i.e., credibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what can one expect from a Separatist
Quebec? Socialism? Yes and no. The first Separatist
 Party, formed about 1960, was leftist (I am not
even considering the 12-member FLQ even if they did
have a thing for bombs and kidnapping), and called
the Ralliement pour l’independence National (RIN).
(&lt;em&gt;National&lt;/em&gt; in French and everywhere else in the world
but American English, does not mean Central or Federal;
 the &lt;em&gt;nation&lt;/em&gt; is a supra-tribe and so a National
Party in Québec is &lt;em&gt;opposed&lt;/em&gt; to the “National” government
 in Ottawa.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the Québec wing of the Social Credit
Party rose out of nowhere to become a major voting
bloc in the federal parliament: the Railiement
Créditiste. The deputy leader of the Quebec wing
was named Giles Grégoire, an intense ideological
type as compared to used-car salesman Réal Caouette,
In great danger of oversimplification, the Créditistes
are sort of a mixture of populism, Birch-style anti-establishment
 conservatism, anti-communism and anti-banker.
 Apart from their monetary theory (like
Milton Friedman?), they are hard-core free enterprise.
Certainly excellent material for conversion to libertarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 1963 election, the RC split with the
national SC; and later Grégoire Split with Caouette—over
 the separatist issue. Single-handedly,
through an adroit use of parliamentary procedure,
Grégoire stopped the entire House of Commons from
doing anything about the Seaway Strike crisis. When
his patriotism was appealed to, he replied that he
owed nothing to Canada, which he did not even believe
 in. He left the House of Commons to start
his own Provincial Party, the Ralliement National
(I told you to watch for that word).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then along came President Charles DeGaulle of
France to infuriate his Canadian hosts and delight
the nationalists. “Vive Le Québec Librel”, the
cry of the separatists, was heard around the world.
In the next election RN got 3% of the vote and RIN
6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Liberal provincial cabinet, René Levesque
heard his call. After leading a small splinter faction
 out of the Liberal Party (and helping the conservative-aligning
 Union National back into power
briefly), he formed a Movement for Sovereignty Assn.
to lobby for a separate Québec. Then, as an election
 approached in the early Seventies, he brought the
RIN and RN into a coalition and formed the Parti Québec.
To put it mildly, with Liberals, socialists and Créditistes,
 it was a “popular front.” The P.Q. scored
24% of the vote, though it won far less seats because
of the distribution of the vote, with Liberals, UN
and RC splitting the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This election Levesque played it cool, called
for reform measures and lower taxes, and even won
the support of the federalist editor of &lt;em&gt;Le Devoir&lt;/em&gt;
(a sort of French-language TIMES) Claude Ryan. He
got 39% of the vote, and the federalists split the
rest. It was worth 68 out of 11O seats, and Levesque
 is now Premier of the province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudeau first said it didn’t matter; then
the Prime Minister said he would oppose the Péquistes
taking Québec out of Confederation by any means he
found necessary. Meanwhile, Levesque is playing moderate,
 calling for a referendum in two or three years
on the question. Needless to say, those of us who do
not believe in political parties expect him to sell
out—but then there are the radicals who just might
not let him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarianism is known to Créditistes: in fact,
I have personally corresponded with a parliamentary
assistant of Réal Caouette (a friend from Alberta).
It could use a lot more exposure—especially to the
Ralliment National but also the more thoughtful Liberals
 and even the radical Leftists if it is presented
 in a sufficiently revolutionary fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no island or coral reef in the middle of
nowhere we are talking about, but a province with a
population of over six million containing the most
cosmopolitan city in North America (eat your heart
out, New York). Yes, there is a Libertarian Party in
Québec, and of course it has made itself entirely irrelevant
 to the struggle there by attacking campus
radicals and mouthing Objectivist code phrases. Qui
est Jean Gait and who cares? &lt;em&gt;Ecrasez l’état&lt;/em&gt; would
sell—but no one is marketing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, the seeds of secession
still planted in the South, New England, the Pacific
Northwest, California, and even New York City might
sprout given the successful example just across the
border. At the very least, libertarians can give
the separatists a chorus of approval and sell their
cause to sympathisers on this side of the line. Who
knows; it might even keep you out of a draftee uniform,
patrolling the streets of Trois Riviéres and dodging
sniper bullets à la Northern Ireland?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Canada"></category><category term="Quebec"></category><category term="separatism"></category></entry><entry><title>a Libertarian 2nd</title><link href="http://www.sek3.net/a-libertarian-2nd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1976-10-01:a-libertarian-2nd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Samuel E.

&lt;h2&gt;A Libertarian 2nd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michele Flynn Stenehjem, AN AMERICAN
FIRST: JOHN T. FLYNN AND THE AMERICA
FIRST COMMITTEE (Arlington House, New
Rochelle, NY, $8.95)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John T. Flynn was one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect three reactions to that evaluation.
 First, there will be the conservative
“libertarians” and Birchers who will wonder why
that could be considered a contentious statement.
After all, did not Flynn fight the Red Conspiracy
for his last 20 years, expose “That Man In the
White House,” and support all sorts of rightist
and McCarthyite groups in the fifties? To the
radical libertarian, hardly a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a very few radical libertarians,
knowing of Flynn’s support for political candidates
 and of his self-silencing on the War
question after Pearl Harbor in the interest of
“national unity” will raise up their hands in
horror at the embracing of this non-“purist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and by far the largest reaction I
expect, is “Who?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1939 to 1941, the single, overriding
issue for everyone in the U.S.A. was World War 2.
Should the U.S. enter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side it should enter on was never in
question, since Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria,
and Romania were “fascist”—and hence reprehensible.
 But fascist Poland was to be valued (though
not democratic Finland). And half-fascist France,
Conservative-Socialist Britain, monarchist North
Africa, Yugoslavia and Greece, and various other
bastions of “liberal democracy” evoked the sympathy
 of the American liberal press—and saving the
British empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the “Great Debate”—as the War
question battle was often called—cut across the
Spectrum. Covert fascists seeing Franklin Roosevelt
 as the American Duce supported interventionism.
 Pro-German Nazis opposed entry simply because
it was on the “wrong” side. Many conservatives,
especially Southerners, were bellicose and jingoist;
 others from the North and West were isolationist.
 The big press, TIMES on both coast, TIME,
PM and LIFE were pro-war; but Hearst, McCormack
and Patterson opposed entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While New Deal “progressives” were all for
King Franklin’s Crusade, the old progressives,
such as Sen. Burton Wheeler, Philip LaFollette,
and the “other” Roosevelts, were solidly opposed.
The Communist Party U.S.A. opposed entry—until
June 1941. Then it disseminated the most blistering
 smears imaginable against its former anti-war
allies and called for Congressional witch-hunts
against the “uh-American“ anti-war movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What of libertarians? Hell, James J. Martin
was unheard of at the time, but anti-war, and Murray
 Rothbard had yet to discover anarchy, and was
an interventionist. Chodorov, Mencken and Nock
were isolationist, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were the liberals. “Liberal”
in U.S. parlance includes Social Democrats, but
Norman Thomas, later used by the CIA in the Dominican
 Republic, and perennial Socialist Party
presidential candidate, worked as an all-but-in-name
 member of Flynn’s New York Chapter of the
America First Committee (NYC-AFC). Thomas was, in
fact, involved in Flynn’s more liberal front, Keep
America Out of War Congress. Another covert supporter
 of NYC-AFC was Chester Bowles, considered
a liberal archetype by many conservatives in the
1960s. Bowles remained in the closet most of the
time because of fear of business loss (he was in
the sensitive advertising industry)—but so did
many conservatives, such as the brothers Richardson
 of Vick Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heroism of Flynn, Oswald Garrison Villard,
 Charles A. Beard and classical liberals of
that ilk has been well-presented by New Left revisionist
 Ronald Radosh in his PROPHETS ON THE
RIGHT (see review in NEW LIBERTARIAN WEEKLY # 1,
11/30/75). The only new things Ms. Stenehjem has
to offer concerning her father’s purge from liberal
 media and blacklisting by Roosevelt was to
add the problems he faced from the infiltrating
Coughlinites, Bundists, Christian Frontists, and
even pro-administration provacateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[FIXME: link to NLW?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning the book at hand, Ms. Stenehjem
is neither hard-core nor a great writer. But her
Subject matter is Fascinating and carries the
book. More than anything else, AN AMERICAN FIRST
is the story of an incredible series of mistakes,
martyrs, mobilizations and mixed premises. And
finally, of defeat when Roosevelt finally goaded
the Japanese into their fatalistic attack on Pearl
Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the mistakes of the AFC can be attributed
 to their mixed premises. Not just the
problems of a wide “pop front” constricted strategy,
 but far more important, AFC limited itself
to direct pressure on Congressmen, and then to propaganda
 to the constituents of marginal legislators
to pressure their Representatives. NYC-AFC was
thankfully saved from direct entry into electoral
activity by its dissolution in December 1941. AFC
worked above all to be respectable, and eschewed
civil disobediance, sabotage, and active and passive
 resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-Viet Nam War “isolationists” used
all of the above, appealing directly to the masses—and
 won the critical point. And where the Student
 Mobilization Committee and peace groups welcomed
 Commies, Trots, and Maoists. Flynn shunned
association with Nazis and anti-Semites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Charles Lindbergh was unafraid to say
what was common knowledge in 1941: that Jewish
organizations and Jewish-owned media were acting,
out of a mistaken ethnic solidarity and from an
unmistaken fear of threats to themselves, as
hard-core warmongers. And although Lindbergh
and Flynn hastened to point out that some Jews
recognized that the fascist threat came from the
New Deal and not the Third Reich, the pseudo-liberals
 pilloried Lindbergh for intolerance and
spattered the AFC with guilt-by-association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to answer why the three reactions to
my embracing of Flynn are wrong. Flynn was a
liberal in the 1930s—but a “classical” one. In
fact, he came close to being a “radical minarchist”—like
 many of the modern limited government
 libertarians who have embraced the anarchist’s
radical analysis of American society while clinging
to the “minimal state” out of philosophical con-
fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn was not only pro-free market, his only
serious Statist deviation in the 1930s, while
writing “Other People’s Money.” a column for the
NEW REPUBLIC, was support of anti-trust. Rightly
he feared the corporate statists Morgan, Rockefeller.
et al; wrongly, he thought the limited state could
and should deal with them. The war issue finally
taught him that the enemy was Washington, and no
succor could be gained from that quarter against
the “triumph of conservatism“ of the Wall Street
“progressives.” Thus, almost coincidentally and
certainly fortuitously, from Dec. 1940 to Dec. 1941,
when organizer of the NYC-AFC, Flynn held an incredibly
 pure libertarian position, far more so than
any other figure in America First.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he was hard-core, cheering up the flagging
spirits, resolving to push ahead during the Lend-Lease
 and convoy defeats, keeping the faithful
pleased, the group pure, and writing tirelessly to
match the pro-War media blitz article for article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it didn’t end well. Flynn dissolved the
Committee when the bombs hit Pearl, and refused to
allow others to carry it on against a “united war
effort,” though he and Thomas did attempt to defend
 civil liberties during the War-repression. He
found only that the New Deal democratic fascists
had no use for “unity” on any terms but surrender,
and he could never sell his writings again outside
the rightist press: AMERICAN MERCURY, Devin-Adair
books, HUMAN EVENTS, a few innocuous pieces for
READER’S DIGEST. Roosevelt wanted unconditional
surrender—from the Axis and from his domestic opponents.
 If nothing else, Flynn’s martyrdom is a
valuable lesson to the modern isolationist, radical
libertarian that there is no relief from the
struggle against the State, that the price for
selling out will never cover the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For John T. Flynn fought the only good fight
available in the bleak, unlibertarlan 1940s. And
then, at least, he was one of us.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Libertarian Strategy</title><link href="http://www.sek3.net/libertarian-strategy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1976-09-01:libertarian-strategy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Samuel E.

&lt;h2&gt;Libertarian Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the myriad programs for reform, revolution,
 emigration, and escape underground, into
the forests, in and under the ocean and to outer
space, the Libertarian Caucus Technique (LCT)
stands out for one distinguishing characteristic:
it has been observed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is not a whole-cloth fabrication
or an attempt to apply other modes of successful
anti-State action to libertarian requirements.
This paper rather puts forward the underlying
principles behind an already proven successful tactic
 so that it may be systematically applied and
used where appropriate and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all plans leading to battle, the LCT can
be thwarted, and the troops can lose themselves in
the process. Since you are fighting for the minds,
hearts and souls of others, that is what you are
laying on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to success of a Libertarian Caucus is
&lt;em&gt;strategic infiltration.&lt;/em&gt; The terms sound cold and
calculated and are meant to. Failure to trigger
the strategy at the appropriate time—regardless
of personal feelings—will blow the technique.
It’s not for the soft-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, LCT is political judo. The pivot
is the “sanction of the victim,” the always-present
vulnerable spot in the State apparatus. Like all
forms of judo, it requires the opponent coming to
you and throwing his weight. You merely adjust the
direction of his trajectory so that he lands flat
on his back, rather than on top of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That requires patience and detachment. The
strategic infiltrator can never force the issue,
nor can he initiate action (beyond setting up the
LC). He must always &lt;em&gt;respond,&lt;/em&gt; react to the issues
that the opposition gives him. Of course, he can
be incredibly adept discovering issues where others
may not have noticed them. But ego-tripping “leadership”
 just doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Libertarian Caucus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caucus technique is an old political
trick, much more prevalent on the Left in the
U.S., but cross-spectrum in parliamentary
countries. A caucus is simply a gathering of
vote-holders &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a larger voting bloc. A
&lt;em&gt;bloc&lt;/em&gt; or coalition in parliamentary countries votes
to keep itself in power. The parties themselves
go “into caucus,” but usually they have separate
internal caucuses representing their ideological
sources of strength. (Notice how close the idea
is to the “sanction of the victim.“)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservative Party of Great Britain has
a “Monday Club” of free enterprise right-wingers
who form a caucus to exert pressure on the Party
to maintain ideology in the face of pragmatism.
The Labour Party has the Tribune Group which does
the same for Leftist ideological purity. The Free
Democrats of Germany had both a Left-caucus and
a National Liberal Action Right-caucus, though the
leaders of the latter have dropped out and joined
the Christian Democrats. The Italian Christian
Democrats are heavily faction-ridden, and their
Left-caucus seeks coalition with Communists while
their Right-caucus contemplates the neo-fascists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., one could think of parliamentary
examples such as the Wednesday Club, Conservative
Study Group, Black Democratic Caucus and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Students for a Democratic Society, which
was an umbrella group of the New Left, was loaded
with caucuses: Worker-Student Alliance, Revolutionary
 Youth Movement, Anarchist Caucus, Independent
 Socialist Caucus, several Trotskyite caucuses,
 and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A caucus serves two functions: one for the
group as a whole, the other for the caucus members.
 It serves the former by keeping the caucused
 faction pacified and part of the group, and
it serves the latter by putting forward their position
 in hopes of making it the dominant one.
The first function is realistic and obviously
works, at least for a time. The latter is not and
does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caucuses which capture temporary control
of the American political parties have either gone
down to defeat (William Jennings Bryan for the
Populists, George McGovern for the radiclibs),
sold out (Thomas Jefferson for the Old Republicans,
 Abe Lincoln for the Free Soilers), Or both
(Barry Goldwater for the conservatives). In a
case by itself was the takeover of the Peace and
Freedom Party by the California “Libertarian” Alliance,
 where the CLA ended up with a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a group simply organized for taking
over a Party would succeed—except that such a
“Power Caucus” would not fulfill the first function
 of gaining the sanction of some principally
principled victims. Contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To defeat this &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; contradiction, the apparent
 one is given up. The strategists of the
Libertarian Caucus enter with the full understanding
 that they will not take power. In fact,
the &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; influence they seem to have, the better
for the strategy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strategic Goal of the LCT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of libertarian activists is the
construction of a viable libertarian society. A
viable libertarian society is a collection of individuals
 who possess the following characteristics:
 rejection of all claims to their lives and
property, refusal to subjugate their selves (egos)
into a collective, and acceptance of an alliance
with other individuals possessing the first two
characteristics for purposes of defense. Any given
individual in a libertarian society need not possess
 these characteristics; but it is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;
that a sufficient number do to fulfill the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need not belabor what is obvious at this
point: libertarianism cannot be imposed from the
top down. &lt;em&gt;Failure&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;impose&lt;/em&gt; libertarianism is,
in fact, a measure of &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt; of libertarianism.
Contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such collectives as political parties and
related ideological organizations and pressure
groups operate counter to the libertarian’s goals.
Thus, the strategic infiltrator has an incomparable
advantage if he is a libertarian: he does not
fear the destruction of the collective he is infiltrating.
 In fact, he welcomes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this point driven home, one must point
out that the short-term or even medium-range survival
 of the infiltrated group is a lesser consequence
 to the strategic infiltrator than his
primary goal: to create libertarians, to add
to his ranks of allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the strategic infiltrator employs
those tactics which foster rejection of the collectivist
 ethic, which encourage rejection of
self-sacrifice, and which raise the consciousness
of the non-aware members to see the concealed
fraud and coercion starkly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Party members are put through a trauma
where they must choose between alternatives which
they earlier felt were compatible. At one of
these crises, the member will reject membership
or embrace it without further reservation. The
latter will join the ranks of the enemy. The
former, if exposed to libertarian thought along
the way, may finally raise their consciousness
 to your level and join you, or work for
your ends on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will basically go into shock from the
trauma, and simply “Browne out.” They reject the
reality of the choice but cannot maintain the
evasion that the choice is not real. They shut
down their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Tactics for the Libertarian Caucus Technique&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactics you work out for use of the
LCT are specific to the group you are in.
Clearly, a tactic for use in the Student Mobilization
 Committee Against the War etc. will be
different from one usable in the John Birch Society.
 On the other hand, some tactics in the
Democratic Party infiltration may be applicable
to Republican Party infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s run through some historical examples
and see what worked. The first case attempted
never got off the ground, i.e., the RLA infiltration
 of SDS. The second case, the RLA infiltration
 of YAF, was incredibly successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infiltrators set up an Anarchist Caucus
 (AC) to explicitly push the hard-core, pure
libertarian position. However, the action was
really fought in the “Libertarian” Caucus, where
those who felt libertarians could work with the
conservative Statists were to be found in large
numbers. The “agit-prop” before the Con raised
the consciousness of the target group. The
literature distributed at the St. Louis Convention
 was a deliberate incitement to the “Trads”
(traditionalist conservatives)—&lt;em&gt;The Tranquil
Statement&lt;/em&gt; of the RLA, &lt;em&gt;The Match!&lt;/em&gt; from SLAM, and
Rothbard’s “Listen YAF” in &lt;em&gt;The Libertarian Forum.&lt;/em&gt;
Rothbard explicitly begins his agitation by
calling for a Schism—equivalent to “seizing the
high ground” in military terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AC brought Karl Hess to speak under the
Arch. Some trad called the cops to break up the
gathering. The AC exploited their put-upon image
and challenged Buckley to debate Hess. Buckley
refused, and the AC now had evidence to
back their claims that the conservative Trads
wanted no compromise with the libertarians. A
defection from the LC slate to the Trad National
Office slate was picked up and used as evidence
that one could not be in both camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, when &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; issue came up, the Trads
throttled back their own hard-liners to pass a
wishy-washy position on conscription to give
the LCers hope of victory “next time.” The AC
struck back with a hard-core position on the draft,
which actually got through committee with some
sympathetic help to become a minority plank.
When it became obvious the delegates were willing
 to accept compromise over schism, one AC
provocateur ignited what appeared to be his
draft card. A simple act—but a contradiction
with the compromise being voted. The resulting
polarisation, split of YAF, and formation of the
modern libertarian movement is well-known, but
the strategic infiltration is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of early attempts by myself to
convert what I observed in St. Louis into a
science brought inconclusive results—a split in
the Anti-War in Cambodia marchers, and the Anarchist
 Caucus at a Wisconsin Young Republican
Convention. A move into the Wisconsin Alliance
(a new Leftist party) showed signs of bearing
fruit but could not be completed as I left for
New York. Just to keep in practice, I split
up a YIP chapter at U.W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New York, various anti-war groups were
infiltrated, but with the exception of the War
Tax Resistors, we met with little success. The
reason is that we had no common identity with
those whom we were seeking to win over. Our
vast differences made it nearly impossible to
have the “better crowd“ see us as articulating
their positions consistently, so the power-trippers
could appear closer to them. (We did pick up a
few anarcho-Leftists at a rally when we started
a chant against a Trotskyist Speaker of “Remember
 Kronstadt! Trotsky was a butcher!”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the classic success story of
strategic infiltration, the break-up of the “Libertarian”
 Party. I followed the above formula
rigorously, with one error, though I knew at the
time I was rushing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1973, the emerging LP had created the
image of a small band of anti-politicians on
the fringes of the movement, mostly Browne-outs,
coral reefers and pacifists, impotent against the
politicians. Two years later, the &lt;em&gt;radical caucus&lt;/em&gt;
had succeeded in restoring the anti-political wing
of the libertarian movement to at least equal status
 with the politicians (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Review&lt;/em&gt;’s
“Essay Review” debate between Crane and myself),
the hard-core, consistent position was conceded to
be (or feared to be when not conceded) on the anti-political
 side, and Party members were purged,
shunned and attacked for merely having associated
with the powerful and deadly &lt;em&gt;rc&lt;/em&gt; and myself—a
witch-hunt in the classic tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TODO: Should we link with LR’s article? —dig.ed.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of how it was done are in &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian Notes,&lt;/em&gt; especially issues # 32 &amp;amp; 33;
I have no intention of repeating them here.
Those reading this publication and seeing the
events of 1974 from Hr. Royce’s view now have
the answer to their common question. “But what
was Konkin after?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TODO: Definitely link NLN when have. —dig.ed.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Costs of Strategic Infiltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One has to choose between friends, who will
not ally, and allies who just aren’t going to
make good Friends. I did, with regrets, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One has to be ready to turn everything into
a success. When the “establishment” (call it
National Office, call it Trads, call it “Partyarchy,”
 call it bosses—but make sure to delineate
a clear, strong, visible enemy) defeats your issue
for more principles, charge them with repression.
When they accept your reforms, charge them with a
co-opt—and immediately hike your demand. The
establishment can do no right—which is, in fact,
one of the truths you are trying to convey. &lt;em&gt;Do
not ever lose sight of this&lt;/em&gt;—never start thinking
that you have a chance to win the enemy over, and
that they can’t be such bad guys. Then &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;
caucus function is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One must be ready to smash what one has built.
In November 1973, the disaster of the Youngstein
campaign swelled the ranks of the &lt;em&gt;radical caucus&lt;/em&gt;
anti-Partyarchy ranks to the point where I foresaw
victory for the reformers at the next convention
in Spring. I thus resigned. (Two years later
they took over and drove Rothbard out—but without
the hard-core in their ranks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can others be trusted not to “sell out” if
they organize a “strategic Infiltration”? Well,
if they have the benefit of watchful support that
I had in the LP such as Andy Thornton, Neil Schulman,
 Abby Goldsmith and others right in the inner
circle, maybe. It’s a real risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this strategy work, say, in the Republican
 Party? I think it can, at least at the lower
levels where the idealists man the ranks of pavement
 pounders. I have no inclination to pursue
the strategy any further for the foreseeable future.
But for those with strong constitutions, high
degrees of control over their emotions, and
strong stomachs for the political sewers, you’re
welcome to the ideas here. Let me know how you
do and we can compare notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics, as the great Frank Chodorov so
well analyzed, is the conflict over plunder yet
to come. Like him, I am willing to soil my hands
in this inescapably rotten, immoral game; and
again like him, I would welcome the day when our
scorn and derision will be sufficient to deal with
politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, we shall have the free society
 for which we long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oft times have you heard from Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist (YFNA) of the necessity
 of Counter-Economics, and from YFNA and
others of its perils and inherent risks. This
time I’ll lay on you a bit of its joy. This anecdote
 is true, though I’ve fiddled and omitted a
bit for “security” reasons. And it begins in the
Counter-Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the City, Los Angeles, Calif. I work
here. I’m an anarchist. (Fill in your own music.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, 10 a.m. I was working on an “independent
 consultant” caper for my anarcho-buddy
Leon. Deadline was rapidly approaching, and we
both hoped a full Sunday would get us back on
schedule. I had arrived early and was churning
out marketable productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I was under attack. Pain. Excruciating.
 Growing. I had to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it wasn’t the State this time (though,
ultimately, I suppose, one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; find it involved
somewhere!). No, it was that old debbil toothache.
O misspent youth! Visions of sugarplums danced
wickedly in my head, and my tooth throbbed in
rhythm to this savage beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, good Anarcho-buddy Leon was concerned
 for my welfare. (There goes the deadline,
he was thinking.) So we called around L.A. to
find a dentist. On a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Zip-all. Nihil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith in the Market wavering, we hearkened
to a suggestion from one of the answering services
of a guy who said he’d drive in from Glendale,
but it would &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; me... We were told that the
University of California at Los Angeles and the
University of Southern California maintained
emergency dentists. UCLA is completely statist,
so we went to USC (which was also much closer).
Leon dropped me off, and I wandered through the
corridors of the sick, maimed and hypochondriac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such sufferings—and was I sympatico. Half
the bureaucrats never heard of dentists there,
and the doctors (at least they were wearing white
coats, etc.) kept pointing out new bureaucrats.
Some efficient-seeming secretary brusquely told
me the dentist was not there, that it was a myth,
and to stop wasting my time. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had not rained (what I consider rain)
in Los Angeles for months. Today it was drizzling
steadily. I hopped a bus back to Leon’s, phoning
him during a transfer. He agreed to call UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCLA confirmed that their dentist was
equally mythological. Now we looked through
the yellow pages, calling a few who boldly advertised
 that they were open late hours and
weekends for emergencies. I guess their crystal
ball told them there weren’t going to be any this
Sunday. They were out. See you Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon, fretting at the time lost, had purchased
 a palliative. I dutifully, but skeptically,
 smeared benzocaine all over the aching
area. He swore that it would work and that he
had personally seen it work on someone who had
worked for him recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t work. Nor was anything else
working. Including me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Isn’t there anybody else?” I queried,
resigning myself to a sleepless night, a forfeited
 deadline, and dread anticipation of a
dental visit. (Yes, I have an irrational, whim-worshipping,
 utterly childish, but paranoid &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;
of dentists.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dialed one last time, an ad that looked
a bit dubious to him, open 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
7 days. It sounded very unprofessional. He
was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommended by the California Dental
Society, which had recommended several golf-players
 earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” said the female gum-chewing voice,
“the doctor will see you at his home, but he
wants me to tell you in advance it’s $30.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. Leon drove me to Hollywood, making
comments on the relatively poor neighborhood,
and what kind of dentist would be hard up
enough to take a patient on a Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helpfully suggested he might be a junkie
and needed the bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at a false-front house, the
door was buzzed open by remote control, and
“Dr. Jack” let us in, to a house, yard, and
connected garage in the back. We were to go
straight to the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All over the walls were posters denouncing
wicked qualities in food. Leaflets denounced
Coca-Cola as poison and ice cream as sugared
putrefaction. Leon, being a native Californian,
was not put out much, but I groaned. A food
faddist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc Jack came in, sat me down, looked in
my mouth, and whipped in the never-to-be-sufficiently-damned
 needle. The pain subsided. He
gave me a card to fill out and talked briefly
to Leon on the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the tooth could be saved by something
 called root-canal therapy. I said I could
care less, I got plenty of teeth, but you’re
the doctor. Just kill the pain for good. (I
suppose I am giving away the depth of my mind-body
 dichotomy here. Ah, well, anything for a
better story.) He had a pile of diplomas, I noticed,
 and Leon remarked that USC had a good
reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned, as I filled out the card,
that the California Dental Society had been no
help in finding him. He said he quit several
years ago. Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked under “employer” where I had written
 “New Libertarian Enterprises.” “What’s new
about it?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quack, about to butcher my one and
only mouth, is questioning me? OK. I’ll humour
him. Maybe he still remembers enough of his
training to get me through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you do?” he persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I work as an independent consultant. I’m
gown here from Canada on a (CENSORED BY AUTHOR)
job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added lamely, “It’s for tax purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then said, “Have you ever heard of the
Free Enterprise Institute?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no, I thought, don’t tell me he’s got it
in for libertarians? He’s actually heard of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh, that’s Andrew J. Galambos’ organization,
right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” he said, “I took six years of courses
before I split with him three years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy anarchoshit! An anarcho-dentist! I
was having my tooth fixed in the ever-lovin’
Counter-Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Leon rapped with Jack about Galambos,
while my anesthesized mouth was uncharacteristically
 silent. Doc Jack told us he hadn’t paid
taxes in four or five years. Considering he got
$140 more from me for less than half an hour of
“root canal therapy,” he’s a good example to us
all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave us a brief attack on how soft-core
the Dental Society was on preventative (as opposed
to restorative) dentistry, and I gave him an NLW
and he Xeroxed the LIBERTARIAN SUPPER CLUB BULLETIN
 I was carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that explained why he was working Sundays;
 he believed in the Market. Faith and health
restored, I left to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it did get me thinking. The next time
some libertarian needs me in the marketplace, will
I be available? (I put in a solid week of overtime,
 and we got everything out, by the way. Happy
ending.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you?&lt;/p&gt;

Konkin, 3rd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That Bread Is Mine, Too (2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part 1 of this article, Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist noted the inordinate
 difficulty that libertarian gurus have
had in defining that which is due the victim of
a crime. Without a simple and sure understanding
of justice, one is lost in deciding complex
questions like: “What are oppressed people due
after a revolution?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFNA pointed out that the fundamental libertarian
 axiom leads immediately to the corollary
that a person is entitled to the following: his
lost property or equivalent market value, cost
of apprehension of the Violence Initiator (VI) by
his protection agent, and the market interest
on the value lost for the time it was out of
his hands. Full restitution, but no more. Any
further imposition on the VI is violence initiated
 against &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which confirms the propriety of
this position is its market practicality. It
is simple to define in any specific case what
is due a victim by simply consulting the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another serendipity. The longer
the VI eludes your trusty protection agent,
the higher is the cost of apprehension, and
the higher his restitution. But even if the
Insurance and Protection Company does nothing
until they are tipped off, he is still racking
up interest for the involuntary loan. So he
has a strong market incentive to turn himself
in and cut his losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the VI resists by naked
violence an assault by p.a.’s (“You’ll never
take me alive, marketeer!”), his restitution
rises enormously. Now he owes restitution to
injured p.a.’s as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the stickiest question of justice 
a has to face is: What of death?
Murder most foul, or even manslaughter. What
value is a human life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, another human life is all YFNA can
come up with, being somewhat mortal himself.
But, more importantly, why not let the victim
decide it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your insurance policy, state what you
want. The execution of your murderer because
you believe in deterrence? OK. But what about
the father who rather have the VI support
his family? (This, by the way, is a basic
position of many tribal codes of justice.) And
what of the idealist who wants a foundation
financed to continue the work he was living
for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, we believe in subjective value
theory, don’t we? To be consistent, then, we
must allow each potential victim (i.e., you) to
decide his own value—or whatever lesser quantity
he will be forced to settle for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to the questions YFNA posed at
the beginning of this essay are now clear. When
the State collapses, the Statists will be
brought to justice by those sufficiently motivated
 to do so. Claims will be handled by the
arbitration and protection agencies. They will
be decided on the simple premise of libertarian
justice: full restitution. The Higher Circles
will have such an enormous debt that they will
be stripped of their holdings, which will be
sold for restitution. Then they will be confined
 to restitution work camps for the rest of
their days, unless the market decides on an incentive
 system to increase their output by offering
 them eventual freedom. Lesser Statists
will have less claims against them and lose less
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacifists naturally need enter no claim if
they wish their oppressors to get off. Native
inhabitants who can present a reasonable claim
for land stolen from their ancestors can regain
their property. Peasants who had their land
confiscated by the State can regain it—a truly
meaningful and just “land reform program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, libertarianism has the answers
for those who apply their God-given or Rand-inspired
 reason to the questions. And if they
ask for their money back, they will get it to
the penny—er, gold milligram, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can get what’s coming to her—but
 only the libertarian way. If someone tries
to sell you another way, look out for his free
lunch and hold on to your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;That Bread Is Mine, Too (1)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the State was smashed yesterday
 morning. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, everybody will go his/her
own way and make oodles of gold. Some of it
will be spent on protection agents and arbitration.
 And we shall be ever-vigilant
against the return of the State!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are we going to do if someone
wants his money back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a question is far from academic,
for one’s view of justice seems to determine
one’s revolutionary tactics. Robert LeFevre,
 the anarcho-pacifist, pursues a
purely educational route because he has
foresworn the use of defensive restitutive
force. What else can he do? Murray Rothbard,
 enamored with “temporary” political
expedients, pursues popular fronts with
rightists, then leftists, then partyarchs.
With his “double restitution” or “restitution
 plus punishment” theory, he finds himself
 allied with the Penal Institution
crowd regardless of other alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand seeks unlimited restitution,
and since infinity can only be achieved
mystically she must resurrect a government—and
 does. John Hospers once wrote
an article for REASON criticizing all libertarian
 theories of justice and choosing
the “lesser evil.” Needless to say, his
strategy operates the same way. It’s called
politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist
 assumes he has made his point.
But he remains bewildered at the confusion.
It seems to him that libertarian justice
is blindingly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before he troubles you with the
obvious, let YFNA justify taking up your
time once more. What if somebody wants her
money back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if someone walks up to you and
says, “David Rockefeller has taken a million
 dollars from me through the State’s
intervention and I can prove it! What
should I, the brand-new libertarian, do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be your answer? Will it be
the same to an Indian seeking relief from
centuries of white-eye long-knife rip-off?
How about Mexican peasants and Bircher suburbanites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, you are properly motivated. Let’s
start out with that fine old libertarian
mainstay, the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; axiom. Remember that
libertarians believe that everyone has an
absolute right to life and property. Fine.
Now Blue Meanie snatches your stereo system
 and a complete set of Beatles’ records.
You discover Mr. M in rapture on his living
room floor. You and your trusty protection
agent have followed the sound of blaring
speakers and you confront him. Old Blue
calls his p.a. and it’s off to arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the arbitrator! And he quickly
ascertains B.M.’s guilt. To what are you
entitled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, as I have said, is blindingly
obvious. Your property! After all, isn’t
&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; what you have the absolute right to?
As a libertarian, how can you disagree? Of
course, if you believe that it has become
the thief’s property by his foul act (a la
LeFevre) you would have given up and not
wasted your time on restitution anyway. But
otherwise, you are clearly entitled to that
which was yours—which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; yours, come hell,
high water, or a plague of statists, if
you are a hard-core, property-loving libertarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s spell it out. You are entitled
 to the stereo system and record collection.
 Anything else? Well, you’ve got
to move it back, so Blue Meanie either hauls
it back under the p.a.’s watchful eye or pays
to have it done. What about the p.a. and
Arbitrator Fineguy? Again, their fee should
be paid by the miscreant who incurred the
cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have your stereo system and
records back, and a record was scratched!
Blue pays for replacement at market value.
It took a day to capture him. All right,
charge him 1/365th of the market rate of
interest (for you) that it would have cost
to have borrowed the money to replace your
machine and your collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now mix in a highly competent Insurance
and Protection Agency. Upon notification
of the Violence Initiation against you, they
verify it and promptly replace your loss.
They then pursue and capture the villain,
prove him guilty, and get their cost and the
cost of your loss out of him. If he can’t
pay—or won’t tell where his loot’s buried—there’s
 always the restitution work camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smooth, efficient, moral—the mark of
the free market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should more be extracted from the
Blue Meanie? Punish him and teach the dastardly
 villain a lesson!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. First of all, full restitution
 (property replacement plus apprehension
 cost plus interest for time loss)
of what’s yours is all you are entitled to.
To get more is to take away from another.
TANSTAAFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you use force, that’s theft.
On &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; part. Hence, by a simple application
 of the fundamental libertarian axiom
we have defined both the minimum you are
entitled to—and the maximum as well. And
lo and behold, they coincide. No broad area
to approximate in, no confusion or fuzziness.
 A sharp, clear, unique answer. For
you unregenerate neo-objectivists, A is A.
You are entitled to that to which you are
entitled. For anarcho-Austrians, it’s
wonderfully praxeological. It’s true and
it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what do we do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CounterCampaign ’76&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last issue Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarchocolumnist
 (YFNA) sketched the last six years
of the Movement’s history again, this time focusing
 on strategy. The failure of all tactics
used until now, with the exception of the somewhat
 arduous Counter-Economic approach (hard
work and all that) was noted, and the Party heresy
 was pointed out as the most blatant failure.
But also noted was the drive for exhibition on
the part of many libertarians, a desire for visibility
 in a Public Campaign. Really, about
the only positive thing the Party ever claimed
for itself was that it attracted people by public
 campaigning (a false claim, by the way—the
Party has yet to &lt;em&gt;convert&lt;/em&gt; one person that I know
of, usually getting its memberships from old
LAers, NBIers, and reader-converts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the problems involved
in a political campaign. First, the Party must
be a monopoly with individuals subjecting themselves
 to compromise or outright sell-out to
unite behind a candidate. Why? To get him a
chance of winning. Why? To take office, of
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the next problem. A libertarian
 in office is another politician with
power to oppress us. Either he has the power
and refrains from using it (threatens us) or
uses it (coerces us). Nobody can be trusted
with that, clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who could we all agree on without sacrificing
 our principles? Behind whom could
students of Murray Rothbard, Robert LeFevre,
Ayn Rand, Leonard Read, Joseph Galambos, Karl
Hess, Robert A. Heinlein, El Rayo, Natallee
Hall, and Harry Browne unite? Nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what candidate can libertarians
even draw from our ranks with enough popular
appeal to bring large numbers into his campaign
that we could then use all our libertarian
wiles on to radicalize? Nobody again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the 1974 election for Republicans,
Democrats, American Independents, and Peace &amp;amp;
Freedomers. 62% (5 out of 8, figure counters)
voted for Nobody. Clearly, she is the most
popular candidate, the favourite for 1976.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who? Why, Nobody, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at her advantages! (I cannot refer
to Nobody as her, actually, since it is not
true that Nobody is female; but it is also
false that Nobody is male. So as courtesy to
feminists, I use the feminine. After all, who
cares if Nobody is offended?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody would give up her power if elected.
Nobody is free from being a focus for factional
strife. Nobody already commands large support
from the people. (Witness NLA’s brief Vote for
Nobody campaign and Sy Leon’s previous League
of Non-Voters activities for instruction in
great publicity at next to no cost.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the seriousness of the Office
of the President, Nobody would stand for a
whimsical, witty campaign to woo the wary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody would fail to seduce the new converts
 into Statism. And Nobody would fail
to have yet another “cult of personality”
spring around her. Blacks and rednecks, feminists
 and male chauvinists, the poor and
the wealthy, the fannish and the sercon,
ex-liberals and ex-conservatives could all
identify at once with Nobody. Who else can
make that claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, speaking of the campaign, I can see
it now. “Nobody in Congress was against
Taxes in ’76. Vote for Nobody!” (Great
around April 15.) “Nobody can represent
your interests in government. Nobody for
President!” “Nobody deserves to live off
your hard-earned tax money. Nobody’s our
Man!” (Or woman, person, sentient, thing...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, dear reader, Nobody can
hold more than one office in the U.S. Nobody
 for Congress! Nobody for Senate! Nobody
 for mayor! Nobody for governor! Nobody
 for dog-catcher...whoops, almost forgot
 about the limited governmentalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get carried away (yeah!) with
the whimsy, such a campaign is kicking off
this year in several stages. On July 4,
Counter-campaign ’76 will be announced to
the libertarian movement. Want a franchise
in your area? After all, even if we have
a State Committee in your area, you could
always set up a Congressional District Committee,
 county committee, assembly district
committee, or whatever. There’s plenty
for everyone. All the National Committee
asks is that if you re-publish &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; ads in
publications we haven’t covered (or put
our your own handbills), split the take
with us 50-50. Otherwise we will send you
a “letter of authorization” for you to
show to local statists with no hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get fast, fast relief from political
anxiety. Nobody can’t sell out! Countercampaign
 ’76 may even have a National Nominating
 Convention in 1976. Best place would
be in Kansas City the week before Labour
Day. Some 10,000 SF fen are expected to
be at the Hotel Muehlebach to hear the
Worldcon guest of honor—Robert Heinlein.
Libertarians and sympathizers will be
highly concentrated there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Chairperson, the State of Virginia
unanimously nominates Nobody for President!”
Cheers, balloons, kick lines. (Feminists
may have male kick lines, if they wish. Nobody
 won’t mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, delegate credentials will
be &lt;em&gt;sold,&lt;/em&gt; blatantly. (Sounds like the regular
 conventions to me—Ed.) After all, Nobody
 is free from corruption. And this being
 the era of Watergate, nobody is free
from scandal and smear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you are, hard-core person. The
problem I posed at the beginning of this column
 is solved. After all, I could not just
carp and criticize without having a positive
plan of action. Nobody would expect that
from me! And remember, you can vote for Nobody
 in the convenience of your own home.
(Send your name and address to the editor of
this publication if you are interested in
either campaigning for Nobody or/and wish
to be a delegate.)&lt;/p&gt;

KONKIN 3rd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Libertarian Strategy (1)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In six years the Libertarian Movement has
learned a lot of lessons. While libertarian
theory continues to evolve and grow, the basic
ideology of 1969 remains valid. In fact, libertarian
 theory has reacted to the stimulation of
the swings and jolts from conflicting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that we are not condemned to relive it,
let’s review our history. As of December, 1968,
libertarian strategy was directed either toward
influence of the conservatives or conversion of
the independents. It was wholly educational or
retreatist. Robert LeFevre’s Rampart College,
Leonard Read’s FEE, Joe Galambos’ FEI, Nathaniel
Branden’s NBI, F. A. Harper’s IHS, and Frank Chodorov’s
 ISI were all educational institutes. The
VonuLifers, Atlantis group, and Oliverites were
seeking escape. Except for the LIBERAL INNOVATOR’s
 leafletting of the Cow Palace in 1964, no
libertarians were involved in a political campaign
 except as deviationist individuals. Many
supported Nixon in 1968, but they were clearly
of conservative leanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very victory of Nixon and sell-out of libertarian-conservative
 modest goals soured these
“campaigning individualists.” The rise of activist
 organizing as an alternative to political
campaigning and the seeming possibility of New
Left revolution attracted the campaigners to a
plausible alternative. Libertarians organized a
caucus within YAF with results we all know. In
December 1968, Rothbard and his small group of
radical libertarians—Block, Tuccille, Childs.
et al.—moved to bring libertarianism into SDS
and the New Left. The Radical Libertarian Alliance
was formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969 the right-coalition tactic exploded
in St. Louis. But within a month the New Left-alliance
 tactic also shattered in New York. To
both the Libertarian Caucus and RLA leaders’ surprise,
 the result was the formation Of independent
 Libertarian Alliances across the country,
with the RLA and SIL central organizations becoming
 just “tendencies.” SIL adapted, becoming
a clearing house to the more scattered locals.
RLA turned briefly from a revolutionary group to
a political campaign group in late 1971, and
the Citizens for a Restructured Republic promptly
died on the campaign trail of 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduation from universities began to decay
the campus-based libertarian alliances from 1970-72,
 and the LA’s began to replant themselves in
the straight communities. Eventually they would
exhibit themselves as Supper Clubs. Libertarian
Churches, or just meetings (e.g.: Gary Greenberg’s
NYLA). These were sound roots being set, but
hardly the spectacular, “shake-the-world” activities
 of the 1969-71 period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More escapism offered itself (Minerva, Abaco)
and the educators kept educating. Many libertarians
 pursued more valuable long-range activities,
combining their business or professional careers
 with libertarian advocacy: running businesses
 on agoric bases, pursuing journalism,
academic research, and even television and
radio (Lowell Ponte, Ron Kimberling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many libertarians also turned inward with
incessant psychology sessions and in-group
self-criticism. This was the Movement as reflected
 in 1972 in, say, NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES,
and which could be pieced together from RAP,
LIBERTARIAN FORUM, REASON, ACADEMIC ASSOCIATES
LETTER, VONULIFE, FREEMAN, SIL NEWS, PACIFIC
LIBERTARIAN, and many local newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in December of 1971, the political
campaign heresy arose again. To put it mildly,
Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist
was hardly an impartial observer of this weed
in our garden. But even then it seemed Obvious
to me from where it drew its appeal. First,
the need for a public “mass movement” visibility
 of many libertarians who were otherwise
quite sound on doctrine. And, second, there
were a lot of newcomers who had not “learned
their lesson” in 1968 and were confused enough
to believe that freedom can be imposed, i.e.,
“voted in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Libertarian Party should have collapsed
as fast as the CRR, since its popular vote was
so far below the number of eligible libertarians
as to show its rejection and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was obvious in N.Y. and Calif.,
the libertarians in the rest of the country
were too scattered to realize their true
strength (about 100,000, according to the lists
of the time, with less than 10,000 voting for
Hospers). Also, the electoral fast shuffle of
Roger MacBride diverted attention from the
overwhelming rejection of the LP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other libertarians campaigned for Nixon
(believe it or not), McGovern, Schmitz, and
Spock; and I have even heard of one or two who
voted for Linda Jenness (Trotskyite). Most libertarians
 didn’t vote, and Sy Leon’s League
of Non-Voters got excellent coverage on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1973 was the year of the LP. The most
viable Opposition seemed to be a radical faction
&lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the LP, though again this was misleading.
The radical caucus (RC) was firmly rooted in
the anti-political libertarian tradition, and
nurtured by all the Movement outside the Party—from
 LeFevrians to Brownians, and even a token
Galombosian!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as a real live political campaign
occurred in 1973, disillusionment began and the
rc’s ranks began to swell. Many partyites
simply dropped out immediately. The re broke
away at the state and national LP conventions
of 1974. By Spring of 1975 only the smallest
state parties on the E. Coast had not suffered
a large split, some “splits” involving nearly
the entire party. Significantly, those who
bolted were often the top activists, newsletter
editors, and theoreticians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long, painstaking construction of
a free society via a Counter-Economy cannot
be short-cut then. But, it may yet be argued,
 is there no way to harness this deep-seated
 drive to campaign publicly, and to
draw in the new recruits that the Goldwater/YAF
 and McGovern campaigns did? Is there no
such thing as a “pure” campaign which can get
all the benefits of the LP electioneering,
but avoid the deadly problems of monopoly organization,
 power-tripping, and, ultimately,
being Judas Goat for the State?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there is Nobody we could run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(next month: Counter-Campaign ’76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carrots And Sticks 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last issue of SLR, Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist decided to toss
some carrots of praise to neglected W. Coast
libertarians and to rest the stick with which
he beats various deviationists. But the coastal
regions of the U.S. have received more than
enough good press coverage. Let YFNA’s roving
eye cast itself on Middle America, that paradise
 promised us by the Prophet Murray, the
Profit Incarnate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado, of course, was gifted (or cursed,
as you will) with the Nolans. But how many of
my friendly neighborhood anarcho-readers know
that one of the truly great libertarians of all
time still lives high up in the mountains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James J. Martin was a hard-core Stirnerist-type
 free market anarchist back in the dim,
dark days of World War II. He fought the draft
and the war with brilliant revisionist history
from the beginning. Martin’s REVISIONIST VIEWPOINTS
 contains essays from the old RAMPART
JOURNAL of Robert LeFevre that are still pace-setters
 in libertarian historiography. Recently
Jim appeared at a libertarian conference which
ran concurrently with the ill-scarred Dallas LP
convention. He may yet return to liven up the
pages of the journals of the modern Movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up north, in Illinois, Joe Cobb prowls. I
have much quarrel with Joe’s present Partyarchist
 actions, but in the sixties he put out a
great little journal called the NEW INDIVIDUALIST
REVIEW: A Journal of Classical Liberal Thought.
In it Murray took cudgel to minarchists, and
Austrians battled with Friedmanites. Joe’s
own chapter of the Radical Libertarian Alliance
was humorous, though perhaps unintentionally,
since he worked for an alliance with ACLU-liberals
 while the rest of the RLA was trying
to embrace the New Left. Whatever degradation
Joe slips into these days, his fame and value
has already been vouchsafed by history, which
is more than the rest of us can safely assert
about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In Barry’s Back Yard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona was the home of the original Student
Libertarian Action Movement, once described by
this writer as the “Weathermen” of the libertarian
 movement. SLAM’s classic battle with the
police on the U of A campus won them accolades
and collections for a defense fund around the
country. Alas, SLAM is gone, after a brief split
into SLAM and “North American Libertarian Alliance,”
though Fred Woodworth and Conrad Goeringer have
gotten together in the modern MATCH! to got their
left-deviationist way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralph Kerner brought the Libertarian Caucus
home from the ’69 YAF-con in St. Louis to La.,
and he and Evan Soule have been fueling the flame
of freedom there ever since. Evan went on to
create the Committee to Legalize Cold, a strange
animal in the libertarian bestiary of front groups.
After all, it actually succeeded in achieving its
goal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lone Star State once boasted Scott
Tips and Mike Holmes, with their HARD CORE NEWS.
“Hard Core” is still the highest exclamation of
approval in the Movement, and the famous Hard
Core sweatshirt is a rare collector’s item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Holmes has since sunk into Partyac, and
Scott has Browned out and moved to Southern California,
 but their legacy remains. Over at
Sul Ross State College, Tony Warnock teaches
“logic,” his name for the basic libertarian principles.
 Tony was once at the U. of Wis. with
YFNA, and gave Free University classes in Praxeology
 while YFNA roused the rabble a bit more
crudely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in Wis. is Don McKowen, trying to liberate
 minds in Milwaukee, a truly Herculean
task. Many a libertarian leaflet has been passed
to the unsuspecting masses by Don, and many of the
Rationalist Church of America objectivists have
been shaken out of their views by his Stirnerism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deep South Folks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Browned out in Georgia, but still
watching us with some interest, is David Rosinge
Dave’s original SOUTHERN LIBERTARIAN MESSENGER
was a brilliant Rothbardian beacon in a branch
of the Movement which once predominantly Randist
and Banneristi. Dave’s activism brought about
the first two Southern Libertarian Conferences,
the second of which featured YFNA routing Mike
Holmes and his attempt to get a libertarian part
going in the bayous and magnolia. Dave has also
been into revisionism, and the only ISOLATIONIST
pamphlet was written by him and printed in NLN
for the now defunct radical caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down at the south end of Alabama teaches a
university professor by the name of Steve Halbrook.
 “Crazy Steve” was one of the great deviationists
 of the Movement, and today’s heretics
 pale in comparison. Today I regard him wit
nostalgia, remembering his articles (like “Classical
 Utopianist Anarchism vs. Leninist Libertarianism,”
 and his urging us to consider Mao
a libertarian) as something a critic could really
sink his teeth into. While his Vanguard Party
thankfully never got off the ground, Steve was
instructive to us in showing how libertarians
should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all Middle American libertarians have
faded into the Shadow World of Mundanity. Still
plugging away in Pa. is the Society for Individual
 Liberty of Don Ernsberger and Dave Walters.
While the coasts never did get into a SIL frame,
preferring libertarian alliances of a local nature,
 most of Middle America knew of other libertarians
 only through their SIL NEWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One neglected area of interest is Canada.
During the heyday of the Libertarian Alliance, a
group put out an occasional journal in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, called THE SKEPTIC. While the zine ha
faded out, it briefly gave hope for the expansic
of libertarianism into some of the more outflung
areas of the world. Currently, revival of activity
 in Ontario and Alberta gives us hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other bright comets soared across the
libertarian skies in the early seventies in the
Middle of the Heartland, and with the upcoming
collapse of the LP and its stifling influence
and rigid conformity to outworn institutions, we
can hope that a general renaissance is in the
offing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(What about the E. Coast? For those readers who
are interested in YFNA’s views on that subject,
a quick subscription to NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES
will bring NLN 40 and “Farewell to the East,”
where that is well taken care of.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abby Goldsmith, another dropout from
state level LP leadership, has been active in
the Movement for many years in Conn. and Fla.
She is a regular contributor to such publications
 as NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES and SOUTHERN
LIBERTARIAN MESSENGER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin, III, is the editor
of NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES, the Movement’s most
outstanding monthly magazine. A doctoral
candidate in theoretical chemistry at NYU,
Konkin plans a move to the west Coast this
summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: NLN 40 wasn’t published until after (it was also NLW 88-89, the fifth all-sf ish) and contained no such material. But it might’ve been published somewhere else...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carrots And Sticks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading over past columns for SLR, Your
Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist notices
that they have been uniformly negative. Now
YFNA is not at all that sort of person who is
gnawed upon by a general hatred. So let the
brickbats flit out of this dark corner, carrying
the corpses of the deviationists they struck,
and let a few kudos be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since SLR is East-Coast-oriented, let me
start by bringing to your attention some Western
libertarians who have been all-too-neglected.
Robert M. LeFevre, for example, shines in the
anarchofirmament with Murray Rothbard, but not,
alas, with the same magnitude in this longitude.
LeFevre has an excellent journal (LEFEVRE’S
JOURNAL, of course) which is free of both deviationism
 and big words like “deviationism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be passed on to your reactionary parents
and read with enjoyment by them, but gives a
thrill to this wild-eyed bombthrower as well.
The only thing I disagree with the estimable
grand old man of Western libertarianism on is
his pacifism, which, when compared to the Partyphilia
 of some other mentors of our Movement, is
like comparing a cold to cancer. And if your
libertarianism is objectivist-based, watch it.
He will mess with your mind without you even
noticing before it’s too late and you may be
too far gone! (LJ, Box 2353, Orange, Calif.
92669, contribution of $10 suggested)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even-handed Lloyd Licher could be credited
with single-handedly keeping the Calif. libertarians
 in alliance since the Browning out of the
great Dana Rohrabacher. Lloyd runs the Libertarian
 Supper Club of Los Angeles; and every month,
the Movement gathers at the Taix Restaurant to
recharge their intellectual batteries with another
 speaker (and fill their anarchobellies
while they are at it). If you want to meet a
lot of libertarians in L.A. quick when you visit
or move there, write ahead of time to Lloyd and
send a couple of bucks so he can mail you his
newsletter and let you know when next they gather
well in advance. (Libtn. Sup. Club of L.A. Newse
letter, Lloyd Licher, 12536 Woodbine St., L.A.,
Calif. 90066, $1.50/year until the postal rates
go up again)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dare I forget John Yench? John 15 a reporter
 for the ANAHEIM BULLETIN, a mild-mannered to
boot. Ah, but when he slips into a telephone
booth, out comes...another Free Enterprise Forum
(libertarian conference, to which he kindly invited
 me last year, to speak, etc.) and maybe
another issue of CHRISTIAN LAISSEZ FAIRE! What?
“Christian”? Yes, and hard-core anarchoagorist,
too. Did he ever check his premises, you ask?
Yes, and he found a big cross over them every
Sunday. I find John indispensible as a contact
with a whole body of people outside the decadent,
unbelieving East and a healthy antidote to the
Conservative Christian quasilibertarian Foundation
for Economic Education. (CHRISTIAN LAISSEZ FAIRE,
Box 772, Anaheim, Calif. 92805. About $2 per
year, last I heard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seymour (Sy) Leon is a hard-core activist
who is also a real live entrepreneur. Sy has
taken LeFevre’s old Rampart College and turned
it into a profit-making Operation. He has been
advance man for Harry Browne, spreading the message
 to those on whom it will do the most good.
He is the instigator and chief honcho of the
League of Non-Voters and has received publicity
for the Libertarian Movement with next-to-no-investment
 and no vote-chasing that the Partyarchs
 would eat their hearts out for. He has so
integrated theory and practice (or should I say
preaching and profit) to make me eat my &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt;
out. (Seymour Leon, Box 11407, Santa Ana, Calif.
92711)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Bates is somebody I just had to
like. He got YFNA to autograph every copy of
NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES he had in his collection.
Chris is also from the Commonwealth (Britain in
his case), and a fan. Of perhaps more import to
the reader, Chris was in the thick of the San
Diego Ten (or eleven, I lost count) Tax Rebellion
Case. And he won. And he could be deported at
any time (like me, for example) without trial
or any other of those statist’s lulls of security.
Chris is like a lot of other “immigrants” I know,
who had this dream of finding a land full of
heroes and Good Guys and, when they found them
scarce, became them to fulfill their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although gone the way of all-too-many anarchomarriages,
 that of Sy and Riqui Leon has been
the biggest boon to the Calif. Movement for several
 years. Riqui was the Dolly Madison of the
Movement, throwing parties every so often at their
Orange County house. Recently she has been prominent
 in defending Women’s Lib from a libertarian
perspective against Arch-Chauvinists such as Murray
 Rothbard. Riqui has also played den mother
to many a libertarian growing up a bit slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I leave Southern Calif., let me not
slight anyone, but simply affirm that there are
many libertarians I know well enough to exalt but
who have not the general fame for their less persistent
 endeavors (generally due to working for a
living, an affliction found rarely on the E. Coast).
And there are others of fame that do not enjoy my
personal knowledge, such as Joe Galambos, Natallee
Hall and Skye D’Aureous, El Rayo and Naomi Gatherer,
 and Lou Rollins, whose good and worthy efforts
will someday earn them a more adept chronicler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us move up the Coast to the neglected
Northwest and stop briefly in Oregon. In Portland
 you will be utterly unable to find, since he
is a confirmed recluse, someone of libertarian
bent who cares little enough for “The Movement”
*bow, scrape*. In fact, he is the fellow who
taught me to write in asterisks like this *praise,
praise* and set a revolution in style and literature
 throughout Science Fiction fandom with his
SCIENCE FICTION REVIEW. Richard E. Geis is passing
through his middle age, but remains young of heart
and Spry of brain, and will probably unfailingly
put out some sort of fanzine that will make me drop
all my activities and labours when perusing my
mailbox and finding him. And have me seek some
nice corner complete with couch to curl up and
read. So his reviews are infallible in telling
you who to read and who not to, though granted,
only for form and style. But if Dick is cavalier
towards content, his unflinching eye will observe
for you who’s saying it well for us and them, and
who is botching it. And as his famous “Alter Ego”
revealed in WORLDS OF IF, he is a lover of “Romantic”
 fiction, that which is written for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;
and not for the literary critic and his set.
(SCIENCE FICTION REVIEW, P.0. Box 11408, Portland,
 Ore. 97211. $4/year)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still further north, in the Washington area,
we find lurking one Joseph Michael Sharp, Mike to
his anarcho-friends. Besides trying to get Libertarian
 Alliances going on Washington campuses, and
keeping campus papers hopping with columns, Mike
tried lighting torches for Ludwig von Mises, even
putting out an issue or two or WERTFREI, a journal
of praxeology. When last heard from, Mike was
Browning, but I assume not for long. He is being
persuaded to grace the pages of NLN with reports
from that Dark Area of our communications, and
perhaps he will be seen in SLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we leave the West Coast, let us not
forget to cast an aloha over the waves. Although
the PACIFIC LIBERTARIAN is gone, Jerrold D. Dickson
 and his FREE has the Movement in Hawaii relatively
 pure and lively. Jerry is also a fan, and
is building a libertarian alliance of some sort,
not scorning our New Libertarians. Hawaii has
always been a hotbed of activism, with a libertarian
 radio station being driven off the air
and libertarians being busted in a Census Resistance
 case, the only such bust from the great Census
 Resistence organized by SIL in 1970. I’m
sure it’s a great comfort to Jerry that I expect
him to follow in their footsteps, but perhaps he
will tread with greater care. (FREE, Box 2776,
Honolulu, Haw. 96803. $5/yr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, says the faithful reader, the West
Coast and the East Coast are filled with the
great and the good. What a pity that the Middle
of the Continent has such a dearth of wise and
true! Hah, replies YFNA. Just wait until the
next issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin, III, is the editor

&lt;h2&gt;Anarchozionism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it’s Abaco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the earliest days of Ayn Rand’s influence
 over the Libertarian Movement, frustrated
activists have given up on their efforts to reform
 or revolt against the American State to seek
the promised Gulch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960’s, a group composed primarily
 of engineers and technologists worked on
a plan to construct an island nation on a shallow
land base of the North Sea. Preform agreed on a
tiny, nominal government, a free port status which
would thrive on free trade between Britain, Norway,
and Denmark. Individuals who had been into education
 and political action (the LIBERAL INNOVATOR,
leafletting the Cow Palace GOP convention) gave up
and published PREFORM-INFORM backing the escapees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the British seized the pirate radio stations
 operating outside their territorial waters.
Oil was discovered in the North Sea, and Britain,
Denmark, and Norway promptly carved up the sea
bed. The Preform crowd either Browned out or
went into escapist trips such as becoming nomads,
troglodytes, or wilderness dwellers. They sought
“invulnerability to coercion”—or vonu—and
PREFORM-INFORM became Vonulife. Recently it
sputtered to a halt, and the paranoia freaks
drifted back to civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Operation Atlantis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Operation Atlantis. Again the
anarchist ocean bed was the site, and a platform-island
 was to be constructed in the Caribbean. A
group gathered in Saguerties, N.Y., took over a
motel, and built a boat. Again they published a
newsletter, and started a commodities operation
(real goods bank) called ATCOPS which took silver
deposits. They even began their own money system,
the Deca (10 grams of silver).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boat sank, and prospective sites were
nationalized, but they still are plugging away in
Saguerties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Michael Oliver and his New Country
project, which eventually decided on a Pacific
coral reef named Minerva. Perhaps the goddess of
wisdom drove the men involved mad for their hubris.
As soon as concrete plans were formed, Oliver
split with the rest. A hardy individualist who
actually went to the reef to photograph it and
lay claim by homesteading was burned by organizers
 when he returned, and the ship that arrived
in N.Y. to carry a load of anarcho-immigrants never
sailed. It just sat in dock and leaked. The comical
 King of Tonga then laid claim to Minerva and
was supported by the less funny states of Fiji and
Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it appears that the Bahamian secessionists
 of Abaco are interested in American backing
and are even willing to listen politely to John
Hospers. But their aims are to set up a state of
their own. The Bahamian state has deported Hospers
as a dangerous Subversive and seem ready to act
to keep their citizenry enshackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can It Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villain in all these plays has been the
State—always ready to move against the opening of
a free society anywhere. But sometimes, dear Brutus,
 we must not look to the stars but to ourselves.
 Why hasn’t the State’s intervention been
assumed from the beginning? After all, these were
libertarians leading and organizing these plans.
Was it not the very frustration with the State’s
omnipresence that lead them to desperate measures?
Why should they believe that the very institution
willing to follow them home, into their pockets
and bedrooms, would suddenly go “hands-off” because
 they crossed some imaginary line on a globe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand’s shrugging Atlases at least faced
a crumbling state, one which was becoming too
weak and incompetent to find and destroy their
embryonic free society. It is self-consistently
obvious that if those who make the statist society
 work abandon it and devote their efforts
to a free society, the State will fall and the
free area will function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But without these people and conditions? A
is A, but suppose you don’t have A? Ayn herself
has never backed a single new country group, to
her credit. My conclusion is that if the promised
 land seekers continue to pursue their Zion
despite a dismal record in practice due to demonstrated
 errors in theory, they don’t need
Rand, Rothbard, or, for that matter, Konkin or
Royce. Szasz and Branden may offer more concrete
assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, anarchy begins at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Revisionism Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly summarized, the study of revisionism
should teach us this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The raison d’être of the State is theft;
that is, acquiring wealth by political rather than
economic means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Those individuals whose wealth depends on
coercion rather than free trade will use all their
wealth necessary to control as much of the State
apparatus as other groups also competing for such
power allow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Such individuals (the power elite, plutocracy,
 “conspiracy,” or “ruling class”) maintain a
common front for statism, but must inherently divide
when some of their interests are attacked by the
state mechanism for the gains of other plutocrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the railway companies supported
the regulation of transport for cartelization. As
cartelization grew, “progressives” advocated govt.
intervention to correct the original statist intrusion.
 The Morgan financial-industrial Eastern
interests supported Theodore Roosevelt and ousted
the McKinley regime so that Roosevelt could institute
 antitrust action against the Midwestern Rockefeller
 interests. Rockefeller backed fellow Ohioan
William Howard Taft, who used the same weapon against
 the Morgans. Morgan then used Roosevelt to
split the Republicans and backed Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War 1 saw Morgan interests heavily invested
 on the Allied side and in danger of bankruptcy.
 Against Rockefeller opposition, the Morgan-Warburg-Rothschild
 grouping of international financiers
 brought the U.S. into the war to bail out
their investments. Rockefeller backed “isolationists”
 such as Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., and with the
support of the quasi-libertarian populace ousted
the Warmongers in Congress in 1918, and Wilson in
1920.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the war, the intellectual community
split, with proto-libertarians such as Albert J. Nock
and Oswald Garrison Villard attacking Wilson and his
new “court intellectuals” for selling out “liberalism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert M. LaFollette lead the Progressives
against the Morgan-interest war. He went down to
crushing defeat in his 1924 presidential race,
dying finally a true enemy of the power elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapidly running down a list of presidential
contenders and the foreign policy each stood for, we
find in the Rockefeller-interest camp: Harding,
Coolidge, Hoover (and Pacific warmonger Stimson in
his cabinet), Wilkie, Dewey, and, of course, Ike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Morgan-interest camp were the following:
Cox, Davis, Al Smith, Roosevelt, Truman, Stevenson,
and Kennedy. Two of the latter were “coalition”
candidates with support from people outside the
Eastern-Midwestern “higher circles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War 2 was fought when the Rockefellers
were bought off by a Pacific war by the Morganites,
who were pursuing an interventionist European policy.
With the “Cold War” setting up Imperial colonies for
all the major statist corporations of the U.S., the
Morgan/Rockefeller split was “rationalized” (Gabriel
Kolko’s term).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950’s, new money emerged in Texas
(oil and computers), South Florida (land and Space),
Southern California (entertainment and aircraft),
and the Pacific Northwest (aircraft and munitions).
These nouveau-riche were termed the “Cowboys” by Carl
Oglesby in contrast to the Eastern “Yankees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John F. Kennedy was a Morgan Yankee, with LBJ
his Cowboy running mate. Richard Nixon was a Calif.
Cowboy with Henry Cabot Lodge his Rockefeller-Yankee
running mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the Yankees was most blatantly
exhibited between 1964 and 1974, the decade in which
they were most threatened. During this time, Cowboys
ran the U.S. presidency but Yankees ran the country
and literally drove from office every Cowboy contender.
When Johnson acquired the presidency through Cowboy
assassination (the CIA is Yankee-run at the top via
the State Dept. and appointed directors, but the
agents.are largely Cowboy-leaning), the Morgans were
toppled. Then Goldwater’s defeat of Nelson Rockefeller
and Scranton put the Cowboys in control of both major
parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Cowboys, as Ralph Fucetola of N.J. has
pointed out to me, are the most established, socially
acceptable Cowboys. So the Yankees joined forces with
them, using their Media-University-Bureaucracy Complex
 (MUBC) to crush Goldwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the place to recall the FDR use of ideology
 to topple his opponents (also, Roosevelt’s running
 mate in 1932 &amp;amp; 1936. Cactus Jack Garner, was
archetypically Cowboy). It brought about a near-coup
by Morgan-DuPont interests, who backed a fascist plot
(See “The Cellophane Conspiracy,” by David Rosinger
in NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES #28). Franklin aborted the
move and mended his fences with his backers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldwater’s major sin was an appeal to ideology.
As was often explicitly stated in the “intellectual”
attacks on him in 1964, Goldwater was unleashing “radicals”
 who would overturn the existing social order—the
 same sin the Morganites accused FDR of in 1934.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ousting of Dean.Burch as GOP national chairman,
 ending Goldwaterite control of the party machinery,
put the Rockefeller Yankees back in control of the
Republicans. In 1968 the humbled Cowboys accepted
Yankee Spiro Agnew as running mate for tame Cowboy
Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Yankees went after Johnson and
dumped him for Yankees HHH and Ed Muskie. Morgan
interests, as usual, Opposed Pacific Front imperialism
while supporting NATO-European interventionism. Rockefeller
 interests were pro-Pacific Front (hence Nelson’s
support of the Indochina war down the line), but anti-Johnson
 Cowboy domestic control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon’s victory in 1968 led to immediate attack
by the Trustbusters on Ling-Temco-Vought, a major Texas
Cowboy conglomerate. However, the Southwestern (Haldeman
 and Ehrlichman) and Florida (Rebozo) Cowboys rode
high in the first Nixon administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGovern’s victory in the 1972 Democratic convention
 veered the party too far to the “radical” (which,
to the Establishment, means “those-who-threaten-our-rule”
 and is applied to left, right, and libertarian
regardless of other views). The most liberal Morganites
hung on with Sargent Shriver’s replacement of Tom
Eagleton, but others defected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, after crushing defeat of semi-radical
candidates, Yankees sabotaged a Cowboy president. Using
local political payoff records and tax dodging
which are usually forgotten when a politico moves
up to a higher office, the MUBC actually drove out
Agnew and replaced him with Rockefeller Yankee
Gerald Ford (Agnew himself was originally a Rockefeller
 Yankee but was acquiring a new Cowboy base).
The remarkableness of this feat is not that they
managed to find and publicize Such records and evidence
 but that the MUBC Suppressed all the available
counter-revelations which existed for every other
politician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Watergate was in fact set up by
Yankee agents to entrap Cowboy operatives is really
irrelevant, though interesting. Such activities are
always going on, and again, it was the revelation
and constant hammering away at the Cowboys’ culpability
 and the Suppression of Yankee malfeasance
which is the notable achievement of the MUBC.
Bringing Nixon to the point of impeachment was the
greatest exhibition of Yankee power, and contrasted
with the Cowboy crudity of relying on assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point that this article is written, the
Yankees are about to confirm Rockefeller as vice
president. With David Rockefeller running the financial
 system of the U.S. and much of the world,
and Nelson as president (after Ford’s predictable
removal) and commander in chief, separation of power
ends in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cowboys are on the run. Howard Hughes,
who controlled Nevada Republicans through Governor
Laxalt, was driven out of the state and out of the
country. Texas oil is threatened by throttling of
oil depletion allowances (acceptable to the entrenched
 Eastern “old money” oil interests); The
Space Program cancellation broke several Cowboy companies
 and Lockheed is on the dole. H.L. Hunt is
dead, his Libya venture seized by a coup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, George Wallace is alive thought not
kicking, and he remains a Cowboy hope for second
spot. And Boeing’s Senator, Scoop Jackson, has a
coalition with organized labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cowboys are also considering a Reagan/Buckley
 third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in U.S. history since 1864,
the question of whether or not there will be future
elections becomes debatable. In fact, the scenarios
to Step the Rockefeller Yankee power consolidation
seem more “far out” than the takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One scenario is a Libertarian Party/Reagan Republican/Wallacite-Bircher
 coalition (exactly analogous
 to the Free Soil Party/Abolitionist Whigs/American Party
 coalition that formed the GOP in
1856) for a radical/Cowboy attack on the Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kennedy’s withdrawal, the Morgans seem
strangely quiescent and willing to let the Rockefellers
 run the Yankee show. If the Democrats put
up a Jackson/Wallace ticket, it will either be bought
out (Jackson at least seems purchasable) or crushed
by the MUBC. Or will it? Can even Such a huge propaganda
 syndicate overwhelm the average American’s
innate distrust of the Rockefellers? The present
indications are that around 80% of the country opposes
 the Rockefeller takeover. So will Rocky
allow an election in 1976, after, as I believe:
he ousts Ford?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer will be, if he thinks he can win,
there Will be an election. If David Rockefeller
estimates that cancelling the Constitution would
incite the populace to back radicals, he will force
Nelson to face election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would oppose him? Jackson/Wallace would
be a Cowboy ticket. On the other hand, another
McGovern-type semi-radical would split the Democrats
and probably win it for Rocky. A Democrat Split
also gives a Reagan Conservative Cowboy group a
chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering who is in ascendancy at a
given time, observe what industries are getting
govt. contracts, Subsidies, quotas, and tariffs.
Who is “Out”? The interests losing govt. contracts,
being trustbusted, receiving bad press, or attacked
as “threats to the ecology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the newspapers and newsmagazines, and work
out the games the “higher circles” are playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarian economic and moral theory are necessary
 to understand the option of a free society,
and revisionism is necessary to understand the
nature of the state, its class support, and its
mechanics. To complete the integrated outlook, a
rounded libertarian must apply his morality, economics,
 revisionist history, and.other fields to
a goal-directed strategy. But that’s another
article!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Agora v. Arena&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the world around you look to a hard-core libertarian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in general, it looks much like it does to everyone else... although
freedom’s advocates
 do fend to have a greater than their statistical share of quirkery and kookery. Libertarians
 are amused by comedy, saddened by tragedy, sweetened by candy, and soured by ill
fortune. Yes it is rumoured that when we are cut, we, too, bleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one difference that we share with perhaps only the devoutly theological and
the Marxist. We have a comprehensive social structure. When we look at a newspaper story, we
integrate the facts into our social theory and draw conclusions. We see mighty and powerful
forces, and sweeps of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-read non-initiate sees facts around
him, but they are confusing and not of a piece.
They make only limited sense and are explained by
ad hoc theories read in yesterday’s column by some
pundit who has already forgotten how he interpreted
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assassination? First reaction: how tragic!
Second reaction: how senseless of that person to
act that way. Third thought: he believed such and
such and therefore... or, he did not seem the type
to kill somebody, so the poor man must be insane!
It is here that the radical libertarian departs from
his fellow man... and not just because he does not
believe in insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the libertarian will end in agreement
that the act was private and motivated by whim of an
irrational man. But before that conclusion, he
will investigate other possibilities—possibilities
that the act &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; motivated by (perhaps not so enlightened,
 but nevertheless) self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will ask: &lt;em&gt;cui bono?&lt;/em&gt; Whose good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariffs are not passed because of the great
belief of the masses in the “American system” or
“Economic Nationalism”—that is just the sales
pitch. The cotton tariff exists because the cotton
agricultural plutocrats financed the lobbying, bought
those who would be, and paid off editors to sling
propaganda and twisted workers to vote against those
who would oppose them. And make deals with other
plutocrats fighting for their interests who control
their bloc of legislators &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; The legislature of
the democratic country in question is then just
the playing field of the powerful interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know the rules of the game and, if they
do not play by them, they get slapped down. The
gladiator may not step out of the ring and stab
Caesar. The political system is the arena of the
ruling class, the power elite, the Higher Circles,
the open “conspiracy” of a State. Political
parties and their factions are the tools, the
mock weapons, the counters on the game board for
the rich and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preach populism and soak the rich? Fine,
turn it into the Populist Party and you have, say,
the silver interests sending a rook against a few
pawns of King Republican. Progressivism your bag?
Excellent, the transportation interests can get
“regulation” which will finally solve the troublesome
 problem of cartelization on a relatively free
market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about social democracy? Good, the industries
 of “peace” which were not getting their
“share” of the federal rip-off known as “taxes”
can now expand their markets of goods for the
needy’s “welfare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely Bolshevism, raw State communism, is
immune to plutocratic gain? Ask Pepsi-Cola, which
was just granted a monopoly over Coca-Cola in the
USSR in exchange for a monopoly of sales and distribution
 in Russian wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, if you have just been brought to the
border of acceptance of this awful truth about
Statism, you recoil in horror at the cynical picture
 presented. Is there no hope, you ask? Can
not a Party of Libertarians escape the fate that
has overtaken every other, from Whig to Nazi?
(And if you believe that the National Socialists
were true to &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; campaign promises, ask an old
follower of Ernst Roehm or Gregor Strasser.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. No hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do we have to play the game in which
the other side has made the rules and has all the
pieces? There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another game whose only rules
are the laws of nature, whose rules we can deduce
from the study of science and praxeology. These
rules are not subject to whimsical legislation and
the clash of interests, whatever interpretation
you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market still works on the basis of supply
and demand. And always will. And anyone who can
get goods with relatively low cost (perhaps with
high risks if there is a lot of State intervention)
to one willing and able to pay a relatively high
price will still earn a profit. The worker usefully
 engaged in satisfying demanded production will
earn his wages—if he accepts the risk and takes
needed precautions against rip-offs. The investor
can still gain his interest by backing the aforementioned
 entrepreneur and labourer—if he hedges
against the State-caused inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those whose wealth arose and is maintained
in defiance of the State and is threatened by the
State’s existence will be moved by self-interest
to destroy his enemy—just as the plutocrat is
motivated to maintain the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the arena over the agora if you will.
I intend to pick up my marbles and go home. And
have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hosperscult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1973, Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarchocolumnist (YFNA—ed.) tore into
shreads an article written by John Hospers, Ph. D. The article fuzzed up the archy/anarchy
controversy, and it will probably be viewed historically as the last ditch defense of minarchy
 through obfuscation. As far as I know, Hospers has ceased &amp;amp; desisted in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me keep the fuzz out of one realm: personalities. Go-betweens inform me that Dr.
John was offended by a lowly doctoral candidate in theoretical chemistry blowing his professorial
 dissertation. Of course, &lt;em&gt;scientists&lt;/em&gt; are required to use rigour and logic on a day-to-day
 basis... No, the good doctor need not feel miffed and was assured of no rancor.
Since his Abaco fomenting, he seems to have broadened his outlook and is developing quite
admiringly. As a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critique I wrote was part of a general attack on REASON. The magazine has improved
somewhat since then, printing some tame anarchists; and, as I said, so has Hospers. But a
new phenomenon has arisen, one which evokes guffaws as a response, hardly deserving of the
ponderous artillery of Aristotle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refer to Hosperscult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFNA has seen many “cults of personality”
 come and go. When he came along
in 1969, Rand was out, Branden was in
decline, Leonard Read was receding, and
LeFevre and Rothbard were shining. Above
all was the intellectual giant, Ludwig
von Mises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were individuals of achievement,
 men and women who stood as examples
of the efficacy of a single person—the
unique one. The heresy of “following” an
individualist is damning enough—but so
easily understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them earned this respect. By
their own efforts. In the all-too-hostile
 marketplace. Nobody “voted” them
awards... until much past their prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then can we think of a movement
which honours those of no visible achievement?
 Surely libertarians, anti-Statists
of all persuasions, cannot regard vote-getting
 as a worthy achievement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for the sake of a column, let’s
suppose that we can admire it as an accomplishment
 of some sort—as we might admire
 the Isolationist aspects of Hitler’s
or Mao’s foreign policy even while recoiling
 in choking fury from their domestic.
 Very well. Now, let’s see, how many
votes &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; Hospers get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No John C. Fremont here. Again, lest
poor Doc John feel put upon, let us throw in
Fran &lt;em&gt;“I Bring Much”&lt;/em&gt; Youngstein, who got one-third
 as many votes as she got petition signatures!
 And let us mercifully forget the
quixotic campaigns of Messrs. Block and Greenberg,
 with their ballotophelic “Outlook.” One
thing we can say about libertarian candidates
in general—they sure don’t threaten us with
their charisma. That is, they are not going
to turn the general public into fanatical arm-banded
 followers for a coup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; charismatic libertarians. Dana
Rohrbacher and Robert LeFevre come quickly to
mind. Is it coincidence that they are anti-“political”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would urge upon my fellow libertarians
an end to attacks on—and thus defense of—the
professor. Let him gracefully slip away after
the coming debacle in California for the LP
there, and get back to his work of self-improvement.
 Perhaps his greatness lies waiting
yet to blossom, and we are distracting and
stunting it by dumping on all this fertilizer
prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the Libertarian Party could move
back in tune with the Movement by offering a
joke candidate. Someone whose only claim to
political accomplishment is the acquisition of
a meaningless office, and who would campaign in
a whimsical, folksy, one-of-the-rednecks
manner. Like an Electoral College graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see it all now: “Don’t Leave
MacBride at the Altar—He’s the Best Man!”&lt;/p&gt;
