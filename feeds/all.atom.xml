&lt;h3&gt;An Interview With the Libertarian Icon Samuel Edward Konkin III (a.k.a. SEK3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conducted by _wlo:dek &amp;amp; michal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t know SEK3 and call yourself a Libertarian? Well,
actually and unfortunately Sam needs an introduction. While
he’s well known among all those Libertarians form Class of ’69 who
were there back in the day, he is virtually unknown among those who
were to young to participate in early Movement. To a degree
he is to blame for this. During the early 90s when most of young
activist were introduced to Libertarianism Sam took a short break
from the libertarian Movement. But now he’s back and kicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who the hell is Samuel E. Konkin III? What is
John Guilt? It took a whole book to answer that
question... As for Sam — Original Libertarian, who earned his
Capital L in the streets of the Battle of St. Louis.
Editor of “The Agorist Quarterly”, “New Isolationist”, “Frefanzine”
and many, many other Libertarian, Agorist, Anarchist, and
anti-interventionist publications, the best known of which is “New
Libertarian” published since 1970 and acclaimed by Mr.
Libertarian (aka Murray N. Rothbard) as the leading
“in-reach” magazine in This Movement of Ours. In 1980 he made
big splash with his “New
Libertarian Manifesto” applauded by Robert LeFevre for its
“position respecting consistency, objective and method” (you can
read it on-line).
To promote Libertarianism he co-funded Movement of the
Libertarian Left, The Agorist Institute and Karl Hess Club.
He organized academic conferences, classes, seminars and
meetings... No wonder, he become a role model for fictional
libertarian heroes created by L. Neil Smith (“The American
Zone”), Victor Koman (“Kings of the High Frontier”) and J.
Neil Schulman (“Alongside Night”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.K. so now you’ve seen the tip of the iceberg, don’t let
me stop you any longer. Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necessary background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Before we start the interview I would like to ask you to
define a term that will pop up many times during this discussion
and as many people think is synonymous. What is
Libertarianism for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Libertarian is another term for Free-Market Anarchist,
though it often includes softer-core fellow travelers such as
minarchists. The word originally was used by free-thinkers in
relation to religion to mean those who believed in free-will over
determinism (which is not all that bad an association for us) and
then became a euphemism for anarchist in Europe in the 19th
Century. It was revived by Leonard Read in the 1940s to mean
those Classical Liberals who refused to join the rest of the
Liberal Movement into becoming soft-Left statists, and who had
largely joined the U.S. Old Right coalition against that kind
of Liberal, bordering on fascist, New Deal. With the election
of Eisenhower and death of Robert Taft, the Old Right coalition
disintegrated. Buckley pulled the pro-State conservatives
into his New Right while Murray Rothbard rallied the Isolationist
(non-interventionist in foreign policy) Libertarians into alliance
with the New Left. New York-based Rothbard became an
anarchist in 1950 and defined the hard-core position
accordingly. Robert LeFevre accomplished the same in the
Western U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Unfortunately many people associate Libertarianism with
Libertarian Party. Some people even believe that it was the
first organization that defined libertarianism. Could you
straight that out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: In 1969, both the SDS and the Young Americans for Freedom
split at their respective conventions. The “right”
Libertarians from YAF joined the free-market anarchists from SDS at
a historic conference in New York over Columbus Day weekend, called
by Murray Rothbard and Karl Hess. In February of 1970,
several activists working for Robert LeFevre organized an even
bigger conference in Los Angeles at USC, which included Hess, SDS
ex-president Carl Oglesby, and just about every big name in the
Movement up to that point. I attended both, as well as the
YAF Convention in St. Louis before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After L.A.’s conference, campus Libertarian Alliances sprung up
around the country. I personally organized five in Wisconsin
during 1970 and a dozen in downstate New York (New York City and
environs) from 1971-73. The Libertarian Party’s first “real”
campaign was Fran Youngstein for Mayor (of New York City) in 1973,
and was the only campaign in which anti-political (what Europeans
would call anti-parliamentarian) Libertarians worked with anarchist
who embraced political office-seekin (whom I named partyarchs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that time, the Libertarian Movement had grown from “Murray’s
living room” (and LeFevre’s Freedom School, later Rampart College)
into thousands in 1970, tens of thousands in 1971, and hundreds of
thousands (some abroad, as in Britain and Australia) in 1972.
The steep rate of Movement growth leveled off with the rise in
visibility of the Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Is it true that few activists started the first chapter of LP
as a joke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Ed Butler, editor of the 1960s Westwood Village Square,
became a Libertarian in 1970. Along with anti-political
Libertarians Gabriel Aguilar (a Galambosian) and Chris Shaefer
(LeFevrian), they registered the name “Libertarian Party” in
California to use for making fun of the electoral process a full
year before David Nolan had his Christmas 1971 party where he
announced the creation of the LP, seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, Murray Rothbard and many others refused to take
Nolan’s party seriously during the Hospers-Nathan campaign.
It would have vanished without a trace had not Nixon Presidential
Elector Roger MacBride not jumped the fence and voted for Hospers
instead of Nixon in the Electoral College (which actually decides
the president in the United States). Walter Block, who was a
rare LP candidate for lower office in New York in 1972, ran his
campaign humorously for the State Assembly by putting out bumper
stickers calling for “Block for Disassembly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: When France was under occupation there was a custom of
shaving the heads of women that collaborated with Germans.
Which ‘libertarians’, except LP, do you think should have the same
treatment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Seriously, I do like your metaphor of Libertarians as
maquis, or Resistance. Nonetheless, there are two big
differences, and I don’t mean how we treat our enemies.
First, we are not parasitically living off the enemy’s economy but
building a better one “underground”; second, we are allowed by the
State (occupation force) to discuss and recruit publicly (at least
for now). I suspect the latter case will cease to exist the
moment they take us as a serious threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Some people become Libertarians after reading Ayn Rand
novels; a book by Hainlein or Rothbard converts some. How did
you discover that you were a Libertarian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Heinlein in Moon is a Harsh Mistress first gave me the
concept (“Rational Anarchist”). When I found out that
Bernardo de la Paz was based on a real person (Robert LeFevre), I
took it seriously. I progressed through the Canadian and then
U.S. Right via Frank Meyer (who, until his death in 1970,
attempted a synthesis of conservative and Libertarian, called
“Fusionism”) and Ludwig von Mises (who called himself a Liberal
right up to his death in 1973 at the age of 92; I knew him for his
last three years). Both led in different ways to Rothbard but
he was being smeared as pro-communist in those Viet Nam War days
for his militant isolationism. The final step was provided by
an anti-communist free-market anarchist named Dana Rohrabacher at
the St. Louis YAF Convention. He was a charismatic
campus activist, radicalized by Robert LeFevre who provided him
with small funding to travel the country with his instrument and
folk songs from campus to campus, converting YAF chapters into
Libertarian Alliances and SIL chapters. Alas, later he fell
into politics, but not the LP. The Libertarian billionaire
Charles Koch supported him in two failed Republicans primary
campaigns, and after Rohrabacher put in time as Ronald Reagan’s
speechwriter, he got his reward of a safe seat in the U.S.
House of Representatives from Orange County. He is still in
office today, with growing seniority. There are few issues on
which he is still Libertarian, certainly fewer than, say, Ron Paul
holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 1969-71, Dana Rohrabacher was the most successful and
most beloved Libertarian activist, and, in my opinion, there would
not have been a Movement without him. And he was a close
friend of mine until he crossed the line with his campaign for
Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: By the way, what do you think about Ron Paul? Many
partyarchs confronted with voluntaryist arguments against electoral
politics point at him and ask: “Look at Ron, do you really think
that he’s destroying the Libertarian movement?” How would you
answer that question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Ron Paul in many ways belongs to another era. His
closest ideological ancestor was the Iowa Congressman H.R.
Gross in the 1960s and 1970s, and Rothbard’s favorite, Congressman
Howard Buffett of Nebraska in the 1950s. One can go all the
way back to the Original who split with Thomas Jefferson’s
Republicans in the early 1800s, John Randolph of Roanoke,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia. The 435-member U.S. House of Representatives
seems to be able to tolerate about one at any time, perhaps as a
court jester, or maybe a lone example of what the House was
supposed to do in theory. Note that there are never two at
the same time. Note also that they have to operate within the
two-party oligopoly. And, finally, note that Paul did NOT
have the guts to join African-American Left-Reform Democrat Barbara
Lee in voting against the enabling resolution of the U.S.
House allowing George III (Bush II) to circumvent a Declaration of
War (against whom? what enemy State?), although he has been a
more consistent defender of both civil and economic liberties after
that vote than Lee has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Paul is too independent to even travel in a pack with
the “Republican Liberty Caucus,” the latest of four attempts to
build a soft-core, conservative voting bloc in the Republican Party
as an alternative to third-party futility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From history to theory...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Many Libertarians seek the birth of the Libertarian movement
during the Young Americans for Freedom convention in St.
Louis. You were one of the participants, could you tell me
what happened there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: The major issues of the 1960s for American youth were the
Viet Nam War and conscription for it, drugs legalization, and
freedom to protest. Libertarians agreed with the New Left
(SDS, etc.) on all these issues and the traditional conservatives
(“trads”) who controlled YAF were opposed. YAF’s first
chairman, Bob Schuchman, was a Libertarian, which is why it was
called the Young Americans for Freedom and not, say, “Young
Conservatives” even though most members identified with William
F. Buckley and National Review. Thus, many young
libertarians were attracted to YAF. In early 1969, the Trads
initiated purges against other Rightists, not just Libertarians;
Objectivist, racists, closet Nazis, Wallacites, and Roman Catholic
radical traditionalists, “Rad Trads” were all ousted wherever they
had control. On the East Coast and California, these were
mainly Libertarian chapters and they showed up in St. Louis
at the National Convention to fight for their credentials.
The Trads dropped their “Conservatism with a Libertarian Face”
approach and allowed only about 200 Libertarian delegates (out of
nearly 1000 before the purges, maybe 500 would have been
Libertarian or other opponents of the National Office). Some,
like me, had been selected by the National Chairman-to-be David
Keene as a loyal supporter, but then switched sides when approached
by Rohrabacher and Don Ernsberger of Pennsylvania YAF (later
founder of SIL) with the stories of what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jared Lobdell (still a close friend of mine) tried to forge a
compromise on the key draft (conscription) issue. However,
during the proceedings after his committee reported, a Rothbardian
anarchist delegate (one of a very few, less than 20) lit what
appeared to be to be a Xerox copy of his draft card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Office (David A. Keene and Jim Farley leading
the vote) won easily and Libertarians were purged from YAF.
But there were variations from state to state. For example in
Wisconsin (where I was then based), I was somewhat protected from
the purge by my closeness to Keene and Lobdell. And Dana
Rohrabacher came to Wisconsin to campaign for David for State
Senate (Keene lost), but actually subverted the Madison UW
chapter. Three of us left on our own and joined with three
YIPpies in late 1969 to form the University of Wisconsin
Libertarian Alliance. But there were dozens, if not hundreds,
of stories like this on campuses across North America. Every
college had a Libertarian Alliance (or SIL chapter) by the Fall of
1970; for the next four years, there were two or more major
Libertarian Conferences a year on the East Coast (New York or
Philadelphia) or West Coast (Los Angeles), all preceding the
“libertarian” Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: In one of the first issues of New Libertarian Notes you had a
discussion with David Nolan about the morals behind running for the
office accusing him of betraying the Libertarian ideals, but a few
months later you joined the Free Libertarian Party of New
York. Was it a sudden change of views or did you just try do
destroy the party from the inside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Actually, it wasn’t THAT early in our publication.
It was in issue 17, in 1972, and it got NLN kicked out of Laissez
Faire Books because I “dared” to compare our exchange to that of
Lysander Spooner and Senator Thomas Bayard in the 1870s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Clark, the founding chair of the New York LP (before he moved
to California) turned over the Free Libertarian Party (it was
called because the New York Liberal Party threatened to sue the LP
for confusing the ballot) to Jerry Klasman. Jerry invited me
to join the FLP Executive Board. When I told him I didn’t
believe in the Party and would work for its demise, he said “That’s
O.K.” In 1973 I was re-elected with the highest vote of any
candidate, but was unable to bring any of the rest of the slate of
the Radical Caucus into office. (The closest second was my
then-girlfriend and later briefly my first fiancee, Nona Aguilar.)
By 1974 we were, in alliance with Upstate Reformers against the
“Anarchocentrist” Manhattan machine, poised to win control of the
FLP. The last thing we wanted (in the RC) was to take
political power, so I and a few of the hardest core (I admit, some
of my comrades were tempted to stay in and try for power) refused
to enter the convention hall and vote. We sat outside and
sold NLNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I had expressed the internal contradictions of
partyarchy. I simply demanded that the LP apply the same tactics of
decentralization and weakening of authority to its own structure as
it wish to do to the State. Rothbard and Gary Greenberg led
the Centralists who argued that the LP had to have disciplined
cadre and a minimum of internal bickering (i.e. debate and
dissent). Strangely enough, my approach seemed to appeal more
to libertarians than their Leninoid tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray Rothbard, viewing the chaos he could no longer control
with frustration, pointed to me through the open door of the
convention hall and said, “Is he the only other person who
understands what’s going on here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left the FLP we had won ourselves Delegate Status to
the Dallas National Convention so we decided to try out tactics
there. I allied our Radical Caucus delegates with challenger
Eric Scott Royce’s delegates (whom we called the Reform caucus),
against the Nolan Machine. But Nolan had already lost control
to Ed Crane, who won easily. At that point, the Radical
Caucus (minus two turncoats) walked out of the LP forever, and we
took quite a few of the Reformers with us, including Royce who has
written for my publications to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: In 1971 you co-hosted “Freedom Conspiracy’s Columbia
Libertarian Conference” during which you had an argument with
Milton Friedman. What was the reason for the argument?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Uncle Miltie took questions, but only written ones.
So I wrote on a card 1. Did you have anything to do with the
passage of withholding of income tax? 2. If so, do you regret
it? 3. If so, would you do it again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my astonishment (and I give him credit here), he read the
card and answered it straightforwardly. To the astonishment
of his audience (he apparently thought they were conservative, not
growingly radical libertarians), Friedman answered . .
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, it was during World War II when he came up with
the idea, in order to raise money for the State faster on behalf of
the war effort. 2. No, he didn’t regret it, since the war was
justified. 3. Yes, for the same reason, he would do it
again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman lost nearly everyone in the audience after that, and
Friedmanism was smashed for good in the Libertarian Movement of
1971. Ludwig von Mises and his student Murray Rothbard, and the
Austrian School reign unchallenged until this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Since that conference many Libertarians often reject the
Chicago school and neoclassical economics as impossible to
reconcile with libertarian ideas. Some people affiliated with
it are still anarchists (i.e. D. Friedman or B.
Caplan). Don’t you think that they are being a little too
harsh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: No. Rothbard proved that the Chicago School
economists are simply efficiency experts for the State. The
worst cases were the Chilean “Chicago Boys” who served Augusto
Pinochet and the Israeli ones who worked for Revisionist Zionist
(i.e., fascist) Menachem Begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: When you lived in New York in the 70s did you have an
occasion to participate in the discussion evenings in Ms and Mr
Rothbard’s house?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Indeed, and enjoyed them immensely. Though the
Movement had already expanded out of “Murray Rothbard’s Living
Room,” it was still the most “in” place to be in the early
Movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: As we know Rothbard’s nature was a bit rowdy and he said many
things that caused a split in the Libertarian movement. How
was your collaboration with him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Actually, Rothbard was seldom responsible for personal
splits; he was quite affable. His speaking manner was, I
described it in NLN, like Woody Allen but with a grasp of
economics. (Allen, by the way, is an Anarchist, though not
free-market.) Originally, he refused to take the LP seriously, so
when I did, I largely drew on LeFevre’s principled attacks on
politics. Rothbard had written anti-political essays before,
so I was surprised that he embraced the LP during the Fran
Youngstein campaign. Perhaps he thought it was a new method
to bring in young professionals, especially attractive female ones
like Fran and her friends. (Youngstein worked for IBM.) At
that point, we split ideologically, though it never got as personal
as, say, Rand and Branden, LeFevre and Sy Leon, or Galambos and Jay
Snelson. Rothbard actively opposed a personality cult
developing. He continued to write for me when I requested,
and we got together in an anti-Kochtopus alliance in 1980 after the
disastrous Clark campaign. I supported him when Crane pulled
Murray’s share in the Cato Institute, effectively purging him, by
my offering him shares of stock in New Libertarian magazine.
And, as I mentioned before, became a Founding Advisor to the
Agorist Institute in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We corresponded right up through the 1990 election (he had
broken permanently with the LP in 1988, pursuing a new
Paleoconservative alliance) and then again, after my divorce in
1992 up until his death in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: There are some who claim that late Rothbard abandoned not
only the Libertarian movement but the Libertarian theory
itself. Could you straight that out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Murray Newton Rothbard, Ph.D., always left himself
maximum latitude in both strategy and tactics, while hewing to what
he called “The Plumb Line” of orthodox libertarianism. It’s
true he ended his life trying to reconstruct the Old Right alliance
of his youth from Paleoconservative and “paleolibertarians,” but he
insisted he gave no ground on libertarian principles. From
his accepting of anarchy in 1950 until his purge from National
Review in 1957 he was part of the Right. But he was purged
for joining the anti-nuclear popular fronts largely run by the
Left, and he accused the “New Right” of abandoning anti-imperialism
and accepting Big Government as necessary to fighting Communism
(evil because it was . . . Big Government).
He was purged from the Objectivists, though he himself was an
atheist, for refusing to pressure his wife into giving up her
Protestant Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked enthusiastically for the New Left through the 1960s,
leaving only when it became obvious the anarchists had been ousted
from the SDS and all important organizations, leaving variants of
Maoism and Stalinism battling over control of ever-smaller
grouplets. He considered supporting a Liberal Republican
(usually anathema to both Libertarians and Conservatives), Mark
Hatfield, for President in 1972, until Hatfield pulled out.
Though he had worked with anti-war Democrats preferentially until
then, he ended up supporting Nixon over McGovern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opposed the Libertarian Party from its founding but mainly on
strategic grounds: he considered the LP “premature” at this stage
of Movement history. When he embraced it after seeing a
superficial popularity for it among many of his activist friends,
he attempted to mold it into his concept of a Libertarian Party:
highly disciplined cadre on the Leninist model. That model
was unattractive to 90% of LP members (and an even higher
percentage of those outside the Party, of course) and when his
candidate was rejected in 1988 (after losing), he noticed Tom
Fleming organizing the Paleoconservatives and threw in his lot with
them, going so far as to become the economics advisor of their
candidate, Pat Buchanan, in 1992. He died before the 1996
election, and without Rothbard, Buchanan abandoned the market for
rampant protectionism and almost selected a socialist (black,
female) running mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: In 1975 you decided to move from New York to California,
preceding that was a three-week journey. There are legends
going around about that trip. Can you tell me something about
it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: It was right out of Jack Kerouac, and anything but in a
straight line. Four of us and what belongings we could take
were stuffed in a Toyota. Although I don’t like to drive, by
the time we hit Oregon (I told you it was not in a straight line),
the rest were so tired they all agreed I should take a turn.
So I crossed the entire length of Oregon in about three hours and
they never asked me to drive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped in Louisville, Kentucky, for the first Rivercon (a
science fiction convention) and visited the best-known libertarian
science-fiction fan back then, Richard E. Geis, in Portland,
Oregon. We got lost in Marin County during its most flaky period
(captured in the novel and film, Serial, perfectly) and drove the
entire West Coast down to L.A. where Dana Rohrabacher found
us apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us would ever go through that again, but we all remember
it as a Rite of Passage and, at least for me, the defining moment
of leaving the ’60s mentality and finally entering that long
amorphous period from 1975 until the Fall of the Berlin Wall in
1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: After you arrived on the west coast you moved with a group of
people into the so called Anarchovillage. Can you explain
what’s hiding under that name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Different people had different aims. Primarily, it
was a “labour resource” for putting New Libertarian out weekly
(yes, you heard it right, every damned week except two for 101
issues) from December 1975 through January 1978. There were
10 apartments and a house, and at our peak we had 8 of them and the
house occupied by Libertarians. Two conservative sf writers
also lived there, one moving in deliberately to be with us.
An old Quaker SDS activist who had holed up there to write SF
discovered we had moved in and joined us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No women had their own apartments, but some visited a lot and a
few moved in with different men, sometimes sequentially. One
in particular worked her way through 90% of us before moving
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we even had a token gay guy, though we didn’t find out about
it for several years (the most promiscuous female, mentioned above,
outed him); he was the apartment manager and friend of Dana
Rohrabacher’s who originally got us the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Contemporary Libertarianism seems to be very loosely attached
to the counter-culture. Something tells me that it wasn’t
always like that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Hmm. I’m not sure how to answer that. As far
as I can tell, what remains of the Counter-Culture is almost
entirely libertarian. The latest “alternative culture” of
cyberspace geeks is not just libertarian but outright
agorist. The hippie counter-culture had unacknowledged
libertarian principles (see Jeff Riggenbach’s In Praise of
Decadence) and Libertarian activists from Kerry Thornley, perhaps
the first conscious “Left Libertarian” (editor of the Liberal
Innovator) to always-Right Dana Rohrabacher embraced it gladly.
Science-fiction fandom, another large alternative culture, has
moved from unacknowledged Libertarianism (Heinlein, Anderson) to
accepting or criticising it explicitly as too dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are implying the current Libertarian Movement is not
entirely counter-cultural and that it used to be more so?
Actually, it’s about the same split between those who largely
embrace the existing culture (such as Rothbard, as straight as you
can imagine) and those who embrace alternatives, though the
alternative offerings have expanded considerably. If
anything, I would say that rejection of the predominant culture is
greater than it was in the 1960s but less overt. Guys (and
now gals) in suits who work in a corporate office, then come home
to smoke dope, chat on-line with subversives, attend their
“alternative lifestyle” conventions on weekends, and flip over
those suit lapels to show a black flag button pinned there, are
common. This “swing both ways” attitude is certainly post-60s
and quite common among our younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and from theory to practice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: During the 60s and 70s many Libertarians cooperated with
groups from radical left, Karl Hess was a member of the Black
Panthers and the Students for Democratic Society, Rothbard
cooperated with M. Bookchin in New York’s Left-Right anarchist
supper club. Contacts between these people broke pretty fast,
why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Very different cases. Rothbard and Bookchin fell
out over rivalry for young new recruits, but emphasized ideological
differences. The Black Panthers and SDS basically fell apart
leaving Hess behind, but Karl continued to work with the Left long
after the 1969 conventions and was affiliated with the Institute
for Policy Studies (IPS) until his demise. But in the late
1980s he reactivated his Libertarian connections, and we invited
him in 1985 to join the Founding Board of Directors of The Agorist
Institute (along with Rothbard, LeFevre, Doug Casey, John Pugsley
and Robert Kephart). Later, he became conservative enough (alas) to
do a stint as editor of the Libertarian Party’s national newspaper,
which ended only as he became too ill to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: People who describe themselves, as Libertarians often don’t
want to be associated with left-wing. Leftists look at
Libertarians with unwillingness. Where did you get the idea
to call your organization the Movement of Libertarian Left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Rothbard decided that we (the original LP radical caucus,
who left the LP as the New Libertarian Alliance, and then promptly
went Underground to build the Counter-Economy) were, using Marxist
terminology, the Ultra-Left Adventurists and Left Sectarians.
Some who remained close to him called me the Trotsky of the
Movement. So it became natural to refer to us as the
Libertarian Left in that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we interested in continuing Rothbard’s 1960-69
alliance with the anti-nuke, then anti-war New Left, so when we
decided to project a presence aboveground again, it made sense to
use a label that would appeal to those remnants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we didn’t want NLA members who were building successful
counter-economic enterprises to feel compelled to return to
anti-political activism so we made it clear it was a different
group who were willing to soil themselves working with
non-agorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had been reading for years the politics of Europe,
Australia and Asia, and in 1978 I was fascinated with a group in
France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that in France then there were two large parliamentary
alliances, and, unlike American political coalitions, these were
highly ideological. But in the Union of the Left AND the
Center-Right alliance, there were members of the once-dominant
party of France known as the Radicals. They had a largely
free-market position on economics, though in neither coalition was
even an old laissez-faire liberal position dominant. The
Radical Partie proper remained allied with the Gaullists and
Independent Republicans of Giscard d’Estaing, but there “left wing”
had split off and joined the Union de Gauche as “The Movement of
the Radicals of the Left” (literal translation of Mouvement des
radicaux de gauche, or MRG). I liked the sound and
implication of that so, with a slight bow to English grammar, our
new aboveground activist group, to join forces with the “old” New
Left to fight the imminent War in Central America, became the
Movement of the Libertarian Left, or MLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What are the main differences between
left-libertarianism/agorism and anarcho-capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: There are several ways of looking at this, from a
theoretical view, from a strategic view, with left jargon, with
right terminology, etc., but it’s a fair question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, those calling themselves anarcho-capitalists (I
believe Jarrett Wollstein, in his defection from Objectivism,
coined the term back in early 1968) do not differ drastically from
agorists; both claim to want anarchy (statelessness, and we pretty
much agree on the definition of the State as a monopoly of
legitimized coercion, borrowed from Rand and reinforced by
Rothbard). But the moment we apply the ideology to the real
world (as the Marxoids say, “Actually Existing Capitalism”) we
diverge on several points immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, agorists stress the Entrepreneur, see
non-statist Capitalists (in the sense of holders of capital, not
necessary ideologically aware) as relatively neutral drone-like
non-innovators, and pro-statist Capitalists as the main Evil in the
political realm. Hence our favorable outlook toward “conspiracy
theory” fans, even when we think they’re misled or confused.
As for the Workers and Peasants, we find them an embarrassing relic
from a previous Age at best and look forward to the day that they
will die out from lack of market demand (hence my phrase,
deliberately tweaking the Marxoids, “liquidation of the
Proletariat”). One can sum that up in the vulgar phrase, “If
the State had been abolished a century ago, we’d all have robots
and summer homes in the Asteroid belt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Anarcho-capitalists” tend to conflate the Innovator
(Entrepreneur) and Capitalist, much as the Marxoids and cruder
collectivists do. (It’s interesting that the gradual victory
of Austrian Economics, particularly in Europe, has led to some New
Leftists at least to take our claim seriously that the Capitalist
and Entrepreneur are very different classes requiring different
analyses, and attempt to grapple with the problem [from their point
of view] that creates for them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agorists are strict Rothbardians, and, I would argue in this
case, even more Rothbardian than Rothbard, who still had some of
the older confusion in his thinking. But he was Misesian, and
Mises made the original distinction between Innovators/Arbitrageurs
and Capital-holders (i.e., mortgage-holders, coupon-clippers,
financiers, worthless heirs, landlords, etc.). With the
Market largely moving to the ’net, it is becoming ever-more pure
entrepreneurial, leaving the brick ’n’ mortar “capitalist”
behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is dealing with current politics and current defence
where Agorists most strongly differ from “anarcho-capitalists.”
A-caps generally (and they have lots of individual variation)
believe in involvement with existing political parties
(libertarian, Republican, even Democrat and Socialist, such as the
Canadian NDP), and, in the extreme case, even support the Pentagon
and U.S. Defense complex to fight communism (I wonder what
their excuse is now?) until we somehow get to abolishing the
State. Agorists, as you have undoubtedly picked up, are
revolutionary; we don’t see the market triumphing without the
collapse of the State and its ruling caste, and, as I point out in
New Libertarian Manifesto, historically, they just don’t go without
unleashing senseless violence on the usually peaceful
revolutionaries who then defend themseelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: The manifesto of MLL was a pamphlet “New
Libertarian Manifesto”. What kind of reaction did it
receive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Strictly speaking, NLM was a manifesto of the New
Libertarian Alliance, not just MLL. It was supposed to have
been published in 1975. But by the time the first edition
came out, MLL had been organized so we included mention of it and
ads for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLM had an amazing reaction. The initial press run of
1,000 ran out, and Victor Koman undertook to print a “deluxe”
version, slick black cover with gold leaf lettering. The
second 1,500 are now sold out except for about 10 copies in my
possession and Victor’s. So a hard-core, purist booklet,
densely typeset to save money (it’s really a small book but we used
small tightly-leaded type to save printing costs), addressed only
to those Libertarian activists at the time who were highly immersed
ideologically and thus a very limited market, became an Underground
Best-Seller. It was never registered with the Library of
Congress or even mentioned aboveground. Laissez-Faire Books
refused to carry it. Only foreign Libertarian bookstores like
the one in Toronto and, of course, Chris Tame’s Alternative
Bookshop in London would carry it. Eventually Laissez Faire
and San Francisco’s Freedom Forum Books would sell it under the
table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray Rothbard immediately agreed to write a critical response
to it, and Robert LeFevre wrote a largely laudatory one. I
found the now-obscure Erwin “Filthy Pierre” Strauss to criticize it
as not radical enough and put them together, with my rebuttals, in
a new journal, Strategy of the New Libertarian Alliance #1 (SNLA1
for short). It sold out, too. We still have a few
copies of SNLA#2 left, but SNLA was absorbed into the Agorist
Quarterly in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: In that text you suggest that counter-economics is the only
way to be conformable with Libertarianism and in the same way an
efficient way to fight with the government. Can you say a
little more about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: Counter-Economics in the sense of actively building and
expediting what was later called “infrastructure” of the
Counter-Economy is the only strategy guaranteed to bring about a
Libertarian Society. As the market passes from under the
control of the State, the free society grows accordingly. At
a certain point, so much of the market is free of the State, and I
mean completely free, no subjugation to any form of State control
including its judicial and enforcement arms, history’s most
successful parasitical social entity will finally perish from
malnutrition. Of course, it will lash out with unfocused
violence to save itself in the final stages, as all collapsing
States do, and the Agorists successful self-defense will be the
Final Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: 20 years passed since the publishing of “NLM” do you think
that since then we’re closer or further to accomplishing its
goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: The Counter-Economy grows, the statist White Market
shrinks and chokes on its own dysfunctional regulation and
creativity-draining tax plunder, throughout the West. In the
East, the nalevo brought down the Soviet state, no matter what
absurd claims for credit the Reagan neoconservatives make.
That is, with limited understanding, the people themselves brought
down the worst tyranny known to man through almost unconscious
agorism. But conscious awareness of the process is
growing. The one weapon the State has still going for it is
that most people who participate in Counter-Economics feel guilty
about it, as if they were doing something wrong, and the
institutional bandit gangs are morally superior. This is what
Ayn Rand brilliantly understood and called the Sanction of the
Victim. The task of Libertarian activists, while it is still
possible to speak freely aboveground, is to prove convincingly to
the masses, especially the young enterprising masses in the global
economy linked by the free-market anarchist haven known as the
Internet, that resistance and disobedience in economic activity is
the MOST moral human action possible. Not just on website,
but in the arts, science-fiction novels and now films, stage, and
the new forms emerging from home computer technology with easily
comprehended interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Lately many Libertarians follow a new strategy promoted by
Free Nation Foundation. They want to build a Libertarian
nation from the base. Cypherpunks have their hope in the
Internet and cryptography. What do you think about these methods of
achieving freedom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEK3: The Cypherpunks provide a useful tool/weapon for the
Counter-Economy, but there is a lot more to an Economy than
that. No one single advance for freedom will achieve the
Anarchist Agora, but none should be discarded or belittled,
either. Kent Hastings has pointed out the value of
nanotechnology, spread-spectrum radio, and small, unmanned, flying
vehicles (I forget the term for them) combined with Net privacy to
expand the counter-economic infrastructure spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nothing against “free country” activists, but I think
they are just setting up an easy target for the State to use its
traditional mass-destruction weaponry to destroy. They rely
on the State having a certain level of moral restraint in all of
their plans to defend themselves, and I think they are wrong.
It has none. It would gladly sacrifice a few million of its
subjects to crush a visible beacon of a functional free society,
let alone a bit of bad press. I call these attempts to build
free countries in today’s statist environment, Anarcho-Zionism,
“The Search for the Promised Gulch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: As a long-time activist I’m sure you follow action of the
younger generation of radicals. Do you think that there is a
chance that Libertarian thought will get to the demonstrators in
Seattle or Prague?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened rather than preached to the anti-globalist anarchists
in Los Angeles (after Seattle, Washington, Prague, etc.) in 2000
but they, including the Black Bloc, had their hearts in the right
place. They were being used by the Old Left apparatchiki through
hyperfeminization and other guilt trips. When former
anarchist Jello Biafra (of the great old punk group, The Dead
Kennedys) called for support of Ralph Nader for president, I
started a call for Nobody for President and was immediately and
eagerly joined by the Black Bloc kids. They had less trouble
grasping the contradiction of an anarchist supporting a
presidential candidate than the “libertarian” partyarchs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Edited for New Libertarian participation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;by Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before 1969&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1969, there was no “organized” Libertarian Movement.
In the 1800s, circles formed around Lysander Spooner’s individualist abolitionism
in Massachusetts, followed by Benjamin Tucker and his &lt;em&gt;Liberty&lt;/em&gt; magazine
(not to be confused with the Seattle ’zine of the 1980s &amp;amp; 1990s) which
upheld the black banner of individualist anarchy from 1870s to 1907. In
that year, the entire stock of back issues and books were burned and Tucker
left America to live obscurely in France until his death in 1939.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orgy of statism peaked first with World War I and then receded. Randolph
Bourne uttered the memorable line, “War is the health of the State”
just before his death in 1918 and the Roaring Twenties saw a brief revival
of freedom. The two main spokesmen were Albert Jay Nock and his &lt;em&gt;Freeman&lt;/em&gt;
magazine (where Suzanne LaFollette first came to prominence) from 1920-24,
and then H.L. Mencken and his &lt;em&gt;American Mercury&lt;/em&gt; in the late 1920s
and through the 1930s until the approach of the second statist orgasm, World
War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nock’s student, Frank Chodorov, was responsible for the first proto-libertarian
student organization in the 1950s, the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists
(still around, but now called the Intercollegiate Studies Institute). Murray
Rothbard, a political fan of Chodorov (but disagreeing with his Georgist
deviation on “The Land Question”), formed the Circle Bastiat in
the late 1950s after being purged from William Buckley’s &lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt;.
(Buckley was a fan of Nock himself, and had described himself as a “philosophical
anarchist” before anointing himself the avatar of modern American conservatism,
having “seen a Dream Walking.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert LeFevre and Leonard Read, like Rothbard and Chodorov, evolved from
the “Old Right” alliance against the ultra-statist New Deal war
machine of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Classical liberals (like John T. Flynn)
and anarchists and even socialists like Norman Thomas joined in the great
America First crusade against U.S. imperialism between 1939 and 1941 with
never less than 80% of the people behind them... until Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeFevre had a fling at running for Congress with the likes of Richard Nixon
in 1948, but soon realized that one could not build a movement for freedom
without first re-informing the American people what freedom was, something
they had lost in five decades of non-stop statism. He formed the Freedom
School in Colorado and his youthful graduates became the original activists
in the student movement. Older people attended Read’s Foundation for Economic
Education in upstate New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothbard was attracted to the growing student movement and actually entered
the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) with his small following. He
broke with those libertarians still clinging to an alliance with the anti-New-Deal
Right by opposing Barry Goldwater in 1964 and beginning publication of &lt;em&gt;Left
&amp;amp; Right&lt;/em&gt; in 1965. He actively attended New Left meetings, wrote for &lt;em&gt;Ramparts&lt;/em&gt;
magazine, and even formed tactical alliances at the Freedom &amp;amp; Peace
Party conventions with Maoists against old-line socialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeFevre’s students began the &lt;em&gt;Libertarian American&lt;/em&gt; in Texas and &lt;em&gt;Liberal
Innovator&lt;/em&gt; (then just &lt;em&gt;Innovator&lt;/em&gt;) in California but, when Kerry
Thornley became editor, also pursued a pro-New Left alliance. The Innovator
leafletted Goldwater delegates at the 1964 Republican Convention at the
San Francisco Cow Palace. Innovator also published the first articles concerning
underground market activity which was later to be known as Counter-Economics.
Alas, the Innovator contributors went underground just as the Libertarian
Movement was about to explode aboveground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Rosenthal, Sharon Presley, Tom McGivern and others broke from the
Youth for Goldwater campaign to form the Alliance of Libertarian Activists,
the first explicitly libertarian activist organization at the end of 1964
at the University of California at Berkeley. Meanwhile, the earlier 1960
Youth for Goldwater which had reformed at Buckley’s Sharon, Connecticut
estate continued to attract libertarian students largely unaware of the
other groups. The new student group, Young Americans for Freedom, had one
libertarian chair, the founder, Bob Schuchman, who rejected the label “Young
Conservatives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, while the early libertarian activists following Rothbard and LeFevre
mostly fought on the side of the New Left, the later and much larger group
of hard-core campus activists who sympathized with liberty found themselves
on the opposite side in the largest anti-New Left group, YAF, in the summer
of 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Word About Ayn Rand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Tuccille’s claim (in his book title and elsewhere) that &lt;em&gt;It Usually
Begins with Ayn Rand&lt;/em&gt; was not accurate, but was indicative. Tuccille
himself joined Rothbard and others in the early pre-St. Louis attempt to
create a Libertarian movement out of YAF and SDS chapters, the Radical Libertarian
Alliance (RLA). Rand herself opposed independent political activism, always
supported Republican candidates (going back to Wendell Willkie) or no one,
and strongly rejected any association with libertarianism. She called her
followers Students of Objectivism and they operated on campuses independently.
(For example, at the University of Wisconsin in 1968-70, around 300 of them
were called Committee to Defend Individual Rights, or CDIR.) But it is true
that many YAF members were influenced by reading Rand, and chapters in Pennsylvania
and Maryland were openly Randist. Don Ernsberger and David Walters of Pennsylvania
formed the Libertarian Caucus within YAF with Dana Rohrabacher and Bill
Steele of California (LeFevrians). According to David Nolan of Colorado,
an earlier Libertarian Caucus was tried at the previous National YAF Convention
of 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Rand’s following who contributed to early libertarianism was
Jarrett B. Wollstein, who created &lt;em&gt;Students for Rational Individualism&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;The Rational Individualist&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Along with Rothbard’s new
&lt;em&gt;Libertarian,&lt;/em&gt; which he changed when he found the name was used by
an obscure newsletter to &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Forum,&lt;/em&gt; and LeFevre’s &lt;em&gt;Rampart
Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rational Individualist&lt;/em&gt; became the leading libertarian publication
until 1971. Also influenced by Rand was Lanny Friedlander, who began a fanzine
called &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for &lt;em&gt;RI&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rampart Journal&lt;/em&gt; was anarcho-objectivist
Roy Childs. Childs wrote an “Open Letter to Ayn Rand” which obtained
no response from her other than the usual purge for questioning her ideology.
But its case that objectivism lead naturally to free-market anarchy left
unanswered provided a conduit for many conversions to libertarianism by
such as philosopher and friend of Childs, George H. Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Ayn Rand split with her chief disciple, Nathaniel Branden, who
had run her activist organization, Nathaniel Branden Institute or NBI. Ex-objectivists
filled the ranks of YAF and SRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 1968, Rothbard attempted a Left-Right Anarchist supper club
in New York with anarchocommunist Murray Bookchin which lasted two meetings.
Rothbard was joined by the former speechwriter for Barry Goldwater, Karl
Hess, in &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Forum&lt;/em&gt; and in SDS activism. Hess went so far
as to join the Black Panthers; his article in early 1969 in &lt;em&gt;Playboy,&lt;/em&gt;
“The Death of Politics,” was second only to Robert A. Heinlein’s
&lt;em&gt;The Moon is A Harsh Mistress&lt;/em&gt; (published serially 1967-68) with its
portrayal of a largely successful libertarian revolution on the moon in
swelling the ranks of the about-to-be-born libertarian movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1969–1974&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Libertarian Movement has a golden age, it ran from August 1969 through
around August 1974. The SDS convention split several ways, purging the anarchists
before the other delegates even arrived. The Young Americans for Freedom
began purging racist and Randist chapters in July, and both sides, libertarians
and traditionalists or “trads,” engaged in “papering”
their chapters with members to maximize delegate strength in St. Louis for
the National Convention over the Labor Day Weekend. Assisting the libertarians
was the proximity of the World Science Fiction convention, also that weekend
in St. Louis, and the number of Heinlein fans who would be attending and
available to accept delegate status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trads, already in power, succeeded in stripping most of the libertarian
delegates of credentials, but about 200 hard-core libertarians retained
delegate status and many who came as trad supporters (such as the founding
editor of &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;)
switched to the Libertarian Caucus when they saw the repressive treatment
of the authoritarian trads. Agitating additionally was the small Anarchist
Caucus of RLA and the Student Libertarian Action Movement, or SLAM. The
AC peaked at about 30 delegates, and could not get more than that for self-styled
“philosophic anarchist” Michael Ingallinera. Karl Hess led a rally
under the famous St. Louis arch which was dispersed by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana Rohrabacher, the “Johnny Grass-Seed” of the Libertarian Caucus,
could not get more than 220 votes and was most popular of the pure libertarians.
Harvey Hukari of Stanford, running independent of both the “National
Office” trad slate and the LC, did better but still could not win.
James Farley, claiming to be a libertarian running on the NO slate, on the
other hand, received the highest delegate vote total (around 500 out of
800). Samuel Edward Konkin III, a Wisconsin delegate, and his anarchist
friend Tony Warnock (both rightly suspected of having been won over by Rohrabacher
and Rothbard) found they had been replaced by alternates when they had gone
for a late breakfast, even though they arrived back an hour or more before
their state’s votes were to be declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most spectacular moment at the St. Louis YAF convention of 1969 occurred
when an AC member lit a xerox of his draft card in front of television cameras
and was attacked by YAF trads football-style. Libertarians tried to form
a line to protect him and the subsequent physical battle radicalized a lot
of “fusionist” libertarian-conservatives. Though some like Jared
Lobdell tried to mollify libertarians with a strong anti-draft minority
plank, and unopposed Chairman David Keene appealed to both sides for unity,
the purges continued after the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fall, the Libertarian Caucus and the Students for Rational Individualism
merged into the Students for Individual Liberty, dually based in Pennsylvania
and Maryland around Ernsberger/Walters and Wollstein/Childs. Rohrabacher
and Steele, after their purge, formed the California Libertarian Alliance,
and announced a huge convention in early 1970. Rothbard and Hess jumped
the gun with a Left-Right Conference at the Hotel Diplomat in October 1969
(Columbus Day Weekend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RLA conference did attract New Left individualists and former YAF anarchists,
but the free-marketeers stayed to hear Rothbard and his Circle Bastiat brothers,
Leonard Liggio and Joseph Peden, discuss economics and revisionist history,
while Hess led a contingent to join the March on Fort Dix of New Leftists.
When the latter returned pursued by FBI agents, the RLA collapsed and Rothbard
swung right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 1970, backed by Riqui and Seymour Leon of LeFevre’s relocated
Rampart Institute (in Santa Ana, California), the California Libertarian
Alliance hosted the Left-Right Festival of Mind Liberation at USC. Nearly
500 activists showed up to hear LeFevre, SDS former president Carl Oglesby,
Hess, Rohrabacher, SEK3, and most of the early activists. Press coverage
of libertarians (such as the con coverage in the LA &lt;em&gt;Free Press&lt;/em&gt;) was
growing, peaking with the 1971 color cover on the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
Magazine (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarian Alliances and SIL chapters spread to every major campus during
1970. The Madison, Wisconsin, UW Libertarian Alliance sprouted chapters
in neighboring high schools and started the newsletter, &lt;em&gt;Laissez Faire.&lt;/em&gt;
Its five issues were the first volume of what was to become &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;. During the Cambodia demonstrations
in May, UWLA rallied former YAFers and YIPpies and was attacked by both
National Guard tear gas units and Maoist Progressive Labor heavies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 1970, SEK3 established contacts with Eastern libertarians,
and brought Columbia students Stan Lehr and Lou Rossetto (now publisher
of &lt;em&gt;Wired)&lt;/em&gt; into the Movement. They formed the Columbia Freedom Conspiracy.
SEK3 moved to New York University and formed the NYU Libertarian Alliance,
changing the newsletter name to NYU/New Libertarian Notes (in ironic homage
to New Left Notes) and recruiting most of the NYU Science Fiction Society
as the kernel of NYULA. Quickly seeding LA’s on other campuses, he formed
the New York Libertarian Alliance, but in deference to the older group,
formed from the objectivist Metropolitan Young Republican Club (MYRC), called
by Gary Greenberg the New York Libertarian Association, NY LA was seldom
used publically, leaving “NYLA” to the association. NYLA was part
of SIL while the Libertarian Alliance was strongly identified with the California
LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYLA and the New York LA worked together on Libertarian Conferences such
as Freedom Conspiracy’s Columbia Libertarian Conference of 1971 where Milton
Friedman was confronted by SEK3 as to his responsibility for the withholding
feature of income tax. Friedman’s ready embrace of the “credit”
excused as needed to fight World War II (which was questioned by most of
the revisionist-historical libertarians there) discredited him and his Chicago
School throughout the Libertarian Movement and put Ludwig von Mises (and
Murray Rothbard)’s Austrian School of Economics in the forefront of free-market
theory. NYULA attended Mises Circle meetings at NYU and Mises was guest
of honor at subsequent East Coast Libertarian Conferences hosted by SIL
at Drexel Campus in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1972, &lt;em&gt;NYU Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt; had evolved from a mimeoed fanzine
into a typeset semi-prozine; with the growing infrequency of &lt;em&gt;The Radical
Individualist&lt;/em&gt; (now just &lt;em&gt;The Individualist)&lt;/em&gt; it became the major
cross-factional publication with its credo, “Everybody appearing in
this publications disagrees.” Still influential was SIL’s &lt;em&gt;SIL Notes,&lt;/em&gt;
but it too began skipping issues. In New York, RLA’s &lt;em&gt;Abolitionist&lt;/em&gt;
was expanded into &lt;em&gt;Outlook&lt;/em&gt; even as RLA changed its name to the Citizens
for a Restructured Republic (CRR) and abandoned Weatherman tactics for electoral
alliances. Rothbard urged support for Mark Hatfield or William Proxmire
as anti-war candidates, but when they were eliminated, he balked at supporting
George McGovern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the west coast, Rohrabacher, Leon and LeFevre published two issues of
&lt;em&gt;Pine Tree&lt;/em&gt; which became &lt;em&gt;Rap&lt;/em&gt; magazine. As usual, the California
Libertarians were far too early and hip for the rest of the movement or
the market. Most ambitiously, Leon Kaspersky tried to distribute a monthly
libertarian tabloid, &lt;em&gt;Protos&lt;/em&gt; but gave up. All failed within a year.
The earliest libertarian bookstore attempt was made by Berl Hubbel in Long
Beach, the prophetically-named Agora Black Market Bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanny Friedlander, based in Massachusetts, sold &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; to minarchist
(term coined by SEK3 in 1970 and appearing in &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; in 1972) Robert
Poole and anarchist Manny Klausner who along with objectivist philosopher
Tibor Machan moved it to California and relentlessly rightward, eventually
out of the Libertarian Movement altogether. It did achieve the highest circulation
of any publication calling itself libertarian at 10,000 (it continued to
grow after it embraced neoconservatism); second was Robert Kephart’s &lt;em&gt;Libertarian
Review&lt;/em&gt; which peaked at 7,000 under its subsequent ownership by Charles
Koch and control by Ed Crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published its cover story on Rossetto
&amp;amp; Lehr of Columbia. In 1972, Edith Efron referred to Libertarianism
as a third position distinguished from Liberal and Conservative in &lt;em&gt;TV
Guide.&lt;/em&gt; Libertarian media recognition began to drop because of a new
organization appearing in early 1972 to the near-universal scorn of the
highly anti-political and even revolutionary libertarian movement, the “Libertarian”
Party or LP. To everyone’s amazement, including the few LP supporters, it
won an electoral vote for its presidential candidate John Hospers, and its
vice-presidential candidate, Toni Nathan, the first woman to get an electoral
vote. As a reward for his defection from Virginia’s all-Nixon electoral
college delegation, Roger McBride was given the 1976 LP nomination and nearly
brought it back down to total obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 1972, Samuel Edward Konkin III and LP founder David Nolan debated
the morality of voting in &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian
Notes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real crucial election turned out to be the New York mayoral election
of 1973; SEK3 and the LA had agreed to join the Free Libertarian Party of
New York though explicitly urging the LP’s destruction; SEK3 won election
to the Executive Committee and promptly built a coalition of upstate minarchists
and Manhattan radicals who matched in strength the New York City “anarchists”
who were willing to oppose the state but embraced party politics: partyarchs
(also coined by SEK3 in NLN). The only campaign which all participated in
was Fran Youngstein for Mayor. Unfortunately, Murray Rothbard was attracted
to Youngstein and his scornful opposition to the LP (he supported Nixon
in ’72 as did Rand) ended. The NLN anarchists, who were Rothbardian in most
respects but adhered to the California Libertarian Alliance (LeFevre) anti-political
position as most consistent, were forced to split and walked out of the
1974 FLP Convention just as their coalition partners were winning control,
leaving a stalemate. However, enough won delegate status to the Dallas National
LP convention to ally with the moderate Reformers of E. Scott Royce who
ran against Edward H. Crane III and the Nolan National Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Royce’s defeat, Crane created an authoritarian machine and purged
several state newsletters as sympathetic to SEK3 and the “radical caucus.”
Those campus LAers who resisted the LP and the LPrc who worked outside the
party as a revived SLAM, now called for a New Libertarian Alliance which
was announced in 1974 after Dallas. As partyarchs geared up for the 1974
congressional elections (which produced nothing), the NLA surged up only
to go... underground. SEK3’s response to electoral politics was refusal to
pay taxes, obey regulations or in any way give the State vampire its blood
— Counter-Economics — combined with Libertarian Theory. In other words,
politically-aware black marketeers, or &lt;em&gt;agorists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1975–1980&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboveground, the Party was left with the dregs and vacillators of the Libertarian
Movement; underground the NLA built its counter-economy. But still another
factor entered in 1975: the vast fortunes of Charles and David Koch, and
the Cato Institute they endowed. Ed Crane, already in control of the LP,
became chair of Cato and disburser of funds. A complex of offices was set
up in San Francisco and Cato bought &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Review&lt;/em&gt; from Kephart,
keeping Roy Childs as editor but hiring Jeff Riggenbach to keep LR actually
running. Riggenbach wrote for NL as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt;
had come a long way; it serialized an interview that J. Neil Schulman had
got with Robert A. Heinlein, the first such interviewed published in decades.
NLN’s circulation took off and it nearly hit a thousand at the 1974 World
Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C. with the final installment
of the Heinlein interview. In 1975, SEK3 finally gave up on the East and
with the hardest core (except for John Pachak, the long-time layout artist),
piled into a Toyota for a legendary three-week trip across the U.S. to relocate
in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between December 1976 and January 1978, SEK3 and those who had come from
New York with him (Andy Thornton, J. Neil Schulman, Bob Cohen) plus Southern
Californians like Victor Koman and Chris Schaefer put out &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian Weekly&lt;/em&gt; —
101 issues of NLW before finally retreating to monthly and less frequent
publication. Ironically, the publication with the best history of on-time
frequent publication (even better than &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; which delayed and skipped
several issues early in its publication career) burned itself out in weekly
production and never returned to regular on-time publication again. During
that time, NLW not only became the premier publication of anti-party libertarians
and “journal of record” of the Movement, but also took up the
cause of opposing “monocentrism,” the monopolization of the Libertarian
Movement by Koch money and power, the legendary “Kochtopus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as NLW sputtered down in frequency to just plain &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine, Rothbard broke with the Kochtopus.
Relations between MNR and SEK3 were maximally strained during 1977 when
Rothbard joined the Kochtopus and moved to San Francisco. Rothbard was described
as the “Darth Vader” of the Movement (&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; had just
been released). Rothbard lashed back with his attack on the “space
cadets” of science-fiction oriented libertarians, and was attacked
himself within the LP by “space cadets” who labeled his faction
“grubeaters.” But Rothbard had a falling out during the 1980 Clark
for President campaign with Crane who controlled the campaign, and his “shares”
in Cato were confiscated by the other Board members. NL promptly supported
Rothbard in his cry, “They stole my shares” and relations were
largely repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Clark and his vice-presidential running mate, David Koch, did get
the highest number of votes ever for the LP (nearly 900,000) but at an incredible
cost per vote. And the few thousand votes Hospers had received in 1972 had
at least got him an electoral vote. The LP began its long decline. (Hospers
himself turned against the LP.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1981–1990&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Rothbard’s opposition to the Kochtopus, Crane’s control slipped
fast. Students for a Libertarian Society quickly collapsed and its handpicked
leader, Milton Mueller, dropped out of the Movement. Cato’s attempt to reach
out to Left-Liberals, &lt;em&gt;Inquiry&lt;/em&gt; magazine, plateaued in circulation
and was combined with &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Review, &lt;/em&gt;which could not break the
5,000 level of circulation. At the 1983 LP National convention, Crane lost
a close battle with the combined Right-Center coalition who put California
state apparatchik David Bergland up against CFR member turned mild isolationist,
Earl Ravenal. Koch’s money was pulled out for the 1984 election and Ed Crane
turned on the Libertarian Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985, at the Libertarian International convention in Oslo, Norway,
Crane and Konkin were to debate the validity of the Libertarian Party for
libertarians. After SEK3’s demolition job, Crane got up and refused to defend
the party, even shaking Konkin’s hand. Alas, Crane was moving rightward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothbard, too, lost interest in the Libertarian Party with no one left
of consequence to fight over it. A feeble attempt was made to stop Rothbard’s
candidate, Republican U.S. Representative from Texas, Ron Paul, from getting
the 1988 nomination., mostly from the Association for Libertarian Feminists
(ALF) who strongly opposed him on abortion. When Paul’s vote continued the
decline from the Clark high, Rothbard blamed the “Left” Libertarians
(apparently still in the LP) and &lt;em&gt;luftmenschen&lt;/em&gt; with no visible means
of support (Agorists and other counter-economists?), and quit the party.
With Llewellyn Rockwell, Rothbard formed the Ludwig von Mises Institute
and announced an alliance with Rockford Institute’s Thomas Fleming and his
paleoconservatives as an attempt to revive the Old Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the LP declined schism by schism, the New Libertarian Alliance
sprouted to aboveground entities. In 1978, the Movement of the Libertarian
Left was formed out of remaining aboveground activists to restore and continue
the alliance Rothbard and Oglesby had begun between the New Left and Libertarians
against foreign intervention or imperialism. MLL’s internal newsletter was
&lt;em&gt;Tactics of the MLL&lt;/em&gt;; it also began a theoretical journal after the
publication of SEK3’s long-delayed &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;. The
responses by Rothbard, LeFevre, and anti-voting/anti-activist Erwin “Filthy
Pierre” Strauss and Konkin’s replies became the basis of &lt;em&gt;Strategy
of the New Libertarian Alliance #1. SNLA#2 &lt;/em&gt;began SEK3’s &lt;em&gt;Agorism &lt;/em&gt;Contra&lt;em&gt;
Marxism&lt;/em&gt; serialization and George Smith’s criticism of Rothbard’s “Leninist”
Libertarianism. Within a decade, Rothbard had swung right and the Berlin
Wall had fallen. (Agorism had made the East European Marxist journals and
was vigorously debated in the early 1980s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 31, 1984 The Agorist Institute
was formed on that symbolic date and with the logo of “the tip of the
iceberg.” So in 1985 MLL was turned over to Victor Koman and Mike Gunderloy
while SEK3, J. Kent Hastings and John Strang concentrated on AI. The &lt;em&gt;New Isolationist&lt;/em&gt; newsletter combined
the editorial skills and writings of Konkin and Royce, with Alexander Cockburn
and Noam Chomsky from the New Left, Thomas Fleming and Charles Reese from
the Old Right, and many other anti-interventionists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;
brought forth its long-awaited time capsule of the new generation of Science
Fiction Authors of the 1980s in 1990. The triple-sized issue, first with
a color cover, mutated into a tribute to Robert A. Heinlein who had just
died. Contributors included Robert Anton Wilson, Robert Shea, Victor Koman,
Brad Linaweaver, L. Neil Smith, J. Neil Schulman, Oyvind Myhre of Norway
and Chris Shaefer on the films based on Heinlein writings. Libertarian science-fiction
fans (frefen) had turned their parties into “Heinlein Wakes” in
the late 1980s, and that culminated in the largest, most international gathering
of libertarian writers at The Hague over the “Bank Holiday” weekend
in late August where NL All-SF Triple Issue premiered. Final copies were
not available until the NASFiC in San Diego the following weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Libertarian Party was in such bad shape that SEK3 called for a ceasefire
and re-direction of energy in the previous issue of NL; with the collapse
of the Berlin Wall, key libertarians “retired” to engage in a
personal life for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1991–Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; had drifted further and further away from mainstream, let
alone radical, libertarianism in the 1970s so that by 1985 only &lt;em&gt;Libertarian
Review&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;
remained with plus-1000 circulations. When LR and &lt;em&gt;Inquiry&lt;/em&gt; quit, NL
was not left alone. Bill Bradford, a lifetime subscriber to NL, started
his own Centrist Libertarian magazine, &lt;em&gt;Liberty. &lt;/em&gt;Briefly, it was inclusive,
but soon it purged Rothbard and Konkin (Bradford claimed an Editorial Board
he created had the responsibility, not him) and it defined itself between
agorist/inclusive NL, paleolibertarian &lt;em&gt;Rothbard-Rockwell Report,&lt;/em&gt;
and the neoconservative &lt;em&gt;Reason.&lt;/em&gt; In 1991, &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; under its
new editor Virginia Postrel crossed the line and became the only publication
to be viewed by some as libertarian to endorse the Gulf War. Even &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt;’s
former editor Robert Poole and Cato’s Ed Crane opposed the naked imperialist
maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the agorists returned to activism in 1994, they found a changed
Movement — but not victorious, as they had assumed it would be. &lt;em&gt;Liberty&lt;/em&gt;
was rehashing objectivism and Ayn Rand’s personal life over and over with
the vapid sneering attacks by cowardly nom-de-plume “Chester Alan Arthur”
substituting for political (or anti-political) analysis; the Libertarian
Party had run an out-and-out scoundrel and party-funds embezzler, Andre
Marrou, for President in 1992; Jeff Friedman was editing a “theoretical
journal” claiming that Libertarianism was based on Egalitarianism (one
of Murray Rothbard’s essays and book titles was &lt;em&gt;Egalitarianism as a Revolt
Against Nature)&lt;/em&gt; and embracing chunks of deconstructionism, postmodernism,
and even Liberalism; and, rather than rallying the demoralized, de-socialized
Left to the Libertarian (black) banner, nearly all factions were cozying
up to (different) parts of the already victorious and thus scornful statist
Right. Reason was gone completely from Libertarianism, as was &lt;em&gt;Reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Chris Hitchens and Alex Cockburn calling for a revived New Left/Libertarian
Alliance on CSPAN and in Left publications, SEK3 and the revived MLL answered
them positively with the pamphlet “What’s Left?” and subsequent
meetings of the Karl Hess Club (successor of the anti-Party Libertarian
Supper Club of Los Angeles and Albert J. Nock/H.L. Mencken Fora). But the
Original Gang Libertarian ranks thinned considerably. Robert LeFevre had
died in 1986; Karl Hess left us in 1994 and Murray Rothbard in January 1995.
The struggle for the minds (what was left of them) and hearts of the Libertarian
Movement was thus engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Isolationist&lt;/em&gt; revived first;
then the long-awaited &lt;em&gt;Agorist Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, the theoretical journal
of The Agorist Institute, challenged
J. Friedman’s &lt;em&gt;Critical Review&lt;/em&gt; and began the development of the foundations
of Counter-Economics and the rest of Agorism. Finally, &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; returned to set the movement straight
again with NL187 in December 1996 (dated April 1997.) Deviationists, sell-outs
and compromisers fled in terror; the hard-core and unyielding defenders
of freedom, as well as those who had been shut out of dominant libertarian
publications for their individualist, non-conforming viewpoints, rejoiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they all turned into .PDF files (Adobe Acrobat™),
moved to the World Wide Web of libertarian cyberspace, and lived happily
ever after...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin III, M.S.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agorism, unfortunately, needs an introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-Economics and agorism were originally fighting concepts, forged in
what seemed to be the ever-cresting revolution of 1972–73, and which proved
to be the last wave instead. Revolutionary rhetoric or not, agorism arose in a
time and a context where slogans required extensive published analysis and
ongoing dialectic criticism with highly committed competing factions. Thus,
when the crucible of “The Sixties”[1] cooled, amongst all the garish Party pennants,
 Trashing rubbish, and exploded-Ideology ashes lay a hard, bright, and
accurate theory and methodology. Probably the first economically-sound basis
for a revolutionary platform, agorism’s market melted away before it could even
get on the display rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins of Agorism: Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Berlin Wall was prefigured twenty years earlier by the
collapse of statist economics, particularly Orthodox Marxism and liberal
Keynsianism. With our release from those reigning dead economists, alternatives
 flourished from heretical “anarcho”-capitalism to deviationist Marxism —
the more heretical .and deviationist, the better. Thanks to the tireless efforts of
Murray Rothbard, paleoconservative (Old Right) class theory and isolationism
was grafted onto (or synthesized with) a free-market economics that was so
pure it generated the same systemic shock as, say, modern Christianity discovering
 original, primitive Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian School economics, particularly Ludwig von Mises’ uncompromising
praxeology[2], was, most appealingly, &lt;em&gt;uncompromising.&lt;/em&gt; Furthermore, it required
no patch-up or cover-up failures; in fact, in 1973–74, it successfully predicted
the gold boom and the subsequent stagflation which so confounded the Official
Court Economists. Mises died at his moment of triumph: Moses, Christ and
Marx to the libertarian movement rising out of the ashes of the New Left and its
dialectic opponent, the student Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray Rothbard was the Gabriel, St. Paul, and Lenin. Rather than watering
down praxeology to gain establishment acceptance and Nobel Prizes (as did
Wilhelm R6pke and Friedrich Hayek, to name two), Rothbard insisted on
radicalizing Austrianism still further.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mises, though adored by radical rightists from Ayn Rand to Robert Welch,
died calling himself a Liberal, though a 19th century Hapsburg Austrian Liberal,
 to be sure. Rothbard, with his academic historian allies Leonard Liggio and
Joseph Peden, insisted that Austrianism went beyond the tepid classical liberalism
 being revived by the Milton Friedmans; it demanded not merely limited,
constitutional, republican government — it required none at all.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could Röpke counsel Christian Democrat &lt;em&gt;Kanzler&lt;/em&gt; Konrad Adenauer
and Birchers love Mises when Rothbard preached outright anarchy? The answer
 lay in praxeology’s crucial concept of &lt;em&gt;wertfrei&lt;/em&gt; — value free. As many
critics later pointed out — even friendly, libertarian ones — economics assumed
 some values at various levels, such as to take the most blatant example,
the value of economic study itself. Nevertheless, suppressing conscious valuation
 allowed Mises to make a far more penetrating analysis devastating to all
political illusionists of his time — but also allowed his theory to be sold in
amputated parcels by selective opportunists and bought by well-meaning but
narrow-focused activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true meaning of Misesian “Austrian Economics” continues to be hotly
debated in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Austrian Economics,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Critical Review,&lt;/em&gt; and libertarian
movement journals, but what concerns us here is what it was perceived as being
at the founding of Counter-Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origin of Agorism: Counter-Economics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian economics answered questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Why do we value and how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ It is inherent in everyone and it is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Why do we give up anything at all ever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Because we subjectively value A more than B while some Other values B
more than A. We do not relinquish; we acquire a greater value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• But why would anyone give up something that is &lt;em&gt;universally&lt;/em&gt; (or as close as
possible) subjectively valued for something of less value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Because that one-thousandth unit of the seemingly more valuable is less
subjectively valuable than the first unit of the seemingly lesser. Who would
consider it folly to trade one’s hundredth loaf of bread for a first diamond?
Utility is marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Why do we have money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Facilitate trade, keep quantitative accounts, make change and store value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• From where does money come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ It arises from commodities exchanged more and more as a middle or
medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Can government improve on money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ No, it is strictly a market function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;What is the result of government intervention anywhere in the market?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Government is force, however legitimized and accepted; all force prevents
subjective value satisfaction, that is, whatever human actors voluntarily give up
and accept is by their personal subjective (and unknowable to others) understanding,
 the best informed outcome to them. Any violence that deters their
exchange is counter-productive to all the exchanges and to those whose exchanges
 depend on theirs — that is, violent intervention is a &lt;em&gt;universal disutility&lt;/em&gt;
in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mises thus concludes that all coercion — and that includes government
action — is not just anti-market but &lt;em&gt;inhumane.&lt;/em&gt; Not bad for value-free assumptions!
 Röpke (author of &lt;em&gt;Humane Economy&lt;/em&gt;), Hayek, and even Mises felt that
once private force or that of another state entered the marketplace, government
counter-force was justified for rectification. Furthermore, none could conceive
of any other way to deal with human protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Murray Rothbard. . .and Robert LeFevre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins of Agorism: Anti-Politics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1964 and 1974, the entire political spectrum save for a sliver of
“liberal” machines in the Democratic and Republican parties were intensely
alienated from politics. The moderate Left had their hopes dashed by Kennedy’s
assassination and looked further Left; the moderate Right pinned their hopes
on Goldwater and were driven out of politics by the establishment-medium
distortions and misrepresentations of his — their — positions. Some turned on,
tuned in, and dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of us pursued what Europeans call so diplomatically extra-parliamentary
 politics. Rothbard and his “East Coast” libertarians pursued an alliance
of alienated “Old Right” and “New Left” for a classical revolution. Robert
LeFevre and his “West Coast” libertarians pursued a civil-disobedience stance:
non-participation in state-sanctioned politics, particularly elections and office-holding,
 coupled with education and activism to expand refusal until the State
could no longer function. By 1969, the Weatherman tactic of exacerbating State
violence with its own to accelerate revolution drove Rothbard to give up his
Ultra Left-Right coalition dream, and support peace candidates. LeFevre remained
 anti-collaborationist until his death in 1986, but civil disobedience and
pacifism went out of fashion in the mid-19705.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins of Agorism: Counter-Economics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when agorism appeared, there were several questions to be dealt with
beyond the answers of then-current Austrian Economics and libertarian politics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Can the State be &lt;em&gt;praxeologically&lt;/em&gt; dispensed with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✓ Answering that affirmatively, as both Rothbard and LeFevre and several
others did...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard and Ernestine Perkins,[5] Morris and Linda Tannehill[6], and David
Friedman[7] and the many contributors to &lt;em&gt;The Libertarian Connection&lt;/em&gt;[8] gave early
answers as to how the market could provide protection agencies which would
be competitive — eliminating the problem of the inherent coercion of the State.
Unable to regulate or tax, able to act only when paid for and asked to protect or
reclaim property, the agency solved the problem of intervention against subjective-valuing
 human actors. Arbitration would replace magistration for justice
— or at least settling rival claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of them describe the &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt; of getting from here (statism) to there
(stateless marketplace or agora). Assuming market entrepreneurs would find a
way, the strategy for achieving liberty was left as an exercise for the readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same 1972 US Presidential election where the power élite did to
George McGovern and the non-revolutionary anti-war left what they had done
to Barry Goldwater, a new party emerged. Although the Libertarian Party
received a minuscule percentage of the vote and was ignored by everyone from
Rothbard to LeFevre, a rebel elector in Virginia bolted Nixon’s overwhelming
majority to putjohn Hospers and the LP on the political map. It turned out to
be the high point of the LP’s success, but with the Fran Youngstein for Mayor
Campaign in 1973, conservative and radical libertarians mingled and then
repolarized. The crucial debate of 1974 was no longer anarchy &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; minarchy, but
partyarchy &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; agorism.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-party majority argued that working within the political system had
failed for two centuries. The new “party anarchists” or &lt;em&gt;partyarchs&lt;/em&gt; argued that
nothing else had worked (everything else presumably had been tried in the
Sixties). At least they had a strategy. Furthermore, it could be perceived to work
in stages and even increments as a law was repealed here or a tax there. Of
course, in the twenty years of the LP’s existence, no “retreat of statism” has been
noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-party libertarians were forced to choose between yet another paradigm
 shift to respond (remember, most had been radicalized from conservatism
to near Weathermen) or give up. Those who remained in the fight with their
new analysis and corresponding strategy took the name of the market to oppose
themselves to political parties and statism — &lt;em&gt;agora.&lt;/em&gt; The new paradigm of the
agorist was called (in tribute to the then-fading Counter-Culture) Counter-Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-Economics is the study and practice of the human action in the
Counter-Economy. The Counter-Economy is all human action not sanctioned
by the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Quantum Mechanics arose by theoretical chemists and physicists
refusing to ignore the paradigm-breaking experiments, and Relativity arose
from Einstein’s acceptance of the Michelson-Morley results, Counter-Economics
 arose as a theory by taking into account what all standard economics either
ignored or downplayed. Just as light tunneled out of Hawking’s black holes,
human action tunneled under the control of the state. And this underground
economy, black market, &lt;em&gt;nalevo&lt;/em&gt; Russia turned out to be far, far too vast to ignore
as a minor correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earliest agorist-influenced science-fiction in 1975, the story[10] predicted
 the USSR would fall to counter-economic forces by 1990 and soon
thereafter turn into such a free-market paradise that it would be invaded by the
statist world lead by the imperialist US. (as this article is being written, the last
of that prophecy comes to pass).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Counter-Economic alternative gave the agorists a devastating weapon.
Rather than slowly amass votes until some critical mass would allow state
retreat (if the new statists did not change sides to protect their new vested
interests), one could commit civil disobedience profitably, dodging taxes and
regulations, having lower costs and (potentially) greater efficiency than one’s
statist competitors — if any. For many goods and services could only arise or be
provided counter-economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the New Libertarian Alliance left their campuses and aboveground
“white market” jobs and went full-time counter-economic for a decade to prove
the strategy’s viability. In 1980, the long-delayed &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; was
issued to those into party politics or other forms of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Agorism Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly little systematic research had been done in counter-economics
since the agorist discovery a decade after the immersion of the agorist cadre.
They surfaced to find a changed political landscape. It had been expected that
their more-timid allies would stay aboveground to conduct officially-sanctioned
 research, but that failed to happen for now-obvious institutional reasons.
 Hence, determined to report their findings, take advantage of freedom of
the press and academic freedom to do so, and, incidentally, raise families, the
publishing cadre formed The Agorist Institute in the libertarian-rich American
Southwest at the end (symbolically) of 1984. The rest of the history of agorism
is the history of The Agorist Institute’s trials and tribulations (which will
presumably be published someday). AI flourished at the end of the 19805,
hitting its nadir as counter-economics — if not full agorism — swept the globe
and tossed socialism into the dustbin of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future of Agorism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the Counter-Economy itself, agorists had a problem with market
feedback operating aboveground, especially in the almost-market-devoid realm
of tax-deductible, educational foundations — a fund-devouring unreality forbidding
 enough to consume a fat chunk of the Koch family fortune and spit out
Charles and David. Although receiving some financial support from mid-range
successful entrepreneurs, AI attempted to do it all: research support, classes,
seminars, academic conferences and publication of journals and newsletters
(internal and external). (All the staff had additional jobs or businesses to
support themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the 1995 revival also marks the AI’s tenth anniversary and the long-awaited
 and delayed publication of this quarterly. Once again, we embark on
studying the vast iceberg below the tip — the Counter-Economy — and report
our findings. To avoid our previous pitfalls, AI is focusing on three self-supporting
 (in short order) publications: &lt;em&gt;AQ,&lt;/em&gt; the already-appearing but infrequent
 &lt;em&gt;New Isolationist,&lt;/em&gt; and new moment-by-moment newsletter of the primary
concern, &lt;em&gt;Counter-Economics.&lt;/em&gt; The test or preview issue, #0, follows this journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has changed in a second decade — but, strangely enough, the
Russian &lt;em&gt;nalevo&lt;/em&gt; market is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; there to study after the Second Revolution — only
this time, we will not be able to rely on CIA-sponsored published accounts[11].
How will the European Counter-Economy, particularly the Black Labor market,
 fare with the dropping of borders? What about Canada’s and Mexico’s
“informal” economies with the passage of NAFTA? Is Hernando de Soto’s &lt;em&gt;El
Otro Sendero&lt;/em&gt; going to win over Abimael Guzman’s &lt;em&gt;Sendero Luminoso,&lt;/em&gt; especially
after betrayal by de Soto’s alleged political (partyarch) disciples, Mario Vargas
Llosa and then Alberto Fujimori? Recently, the former &lt;em&gt;Comandate Cero&lt;/em&gt; of the
&lt;em&gt;Tercerista&lt;/em&gt; (uncompromising) faction of the Sandanistas, Eden Pastora, chose
the agorist Karl Hess Club to announce his candidacy for President of Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the United States? How does all the above affect America’s
counter-economic foreign interface [academic for “the smuggling industry”]?
What effect will Clinton’s State medicine do to the health-providing service?
Will all medical treatment end up like 19505 abortion, and will people grab free
needles at the AIDS-prevention center to give to their black doctors for unauthorized
 immunization of their children who cannot wait their “turn” (due after
their scheduled death, as in Canada and England)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every issue in today’s press from Bosnia to Oklahoma City has an overlooked
Counter-Economic component that AI can explore, compile and publish. Other
areas can be excavated from the underground that will &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; issues once
exposed and explained, and then there is the new battleground for agorists and
statists: cyberspace, where cypherpunk agorist road warriors have an early lead
over the Gore statist superhighwaymen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, finally and overall, the issue needing the most immediate attention is
that of agorism itself. To the extent that it is “agorology” and not just ideology,
what is and should be its methodology? We most urgently invite our newly
awakened and empowered students of agorism and multi-disciplinarians of
counter-economics to contribute their first — and second — thoughts on the
subject. Are some methods out of bounds in agorism that are academically
acceptable, for example? Or are some methods acceptable in counter-economic
study that are unacceptable to academic researchers? Can we be &lt;em&gt;wertfrei&lt;/em&gt; when
we are obviously attracted to the Black as Departments of Marxist Studies are to
the Red? Should there be &lt;em&gt;competing&lt;/em&gt; methodologies? (In case there was the least
doubt, AI encourages one, two, many agorist foundations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about that new Power Mac equipment to hook up to the Video
Toaster? Is traditional publishing enough or should it be supplemented — or
supplanted — by full-scale video production passed along by Videotape — or
hurtled through the Internet like “Breaker, breaker” trucks on the information
superhighway? Should AQ continue to appear on paper, or in .PDF on-line files
as &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine is now doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is “Rightist” Militia instead of New Left cadre blowing up federal
buildings and protesting massacres of peaceful women and children, but fighting
for freedom against the American Empire is turning serious again. In an
important way, our Nineties are like the Sixties: we don’t know where we’re
going to end up, but we know we’re on our way. Or, in 90s’ parlance, as our
children’s spokesperson would say, when asked about “the future,” agorists
answer, “The Future? We’re &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...by which &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; mean November 1963 to August 1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, especially. &lt;em&gt;Human Action&lt;/em&gt; in any of its numerous editions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power and Market,&lt;/em&gt; his “completion” of &lt;em&gt;Man, Economy and State&lt;/em&gt; (which itself was a rewrite of
&lt;em&gt;Human Action)&lt;/em&gt; had just come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, as I reflected back to Murray around 1971, “You mean, we’re not classical Liberals,
we’re classical Radicals!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work is long out of print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Market for Liberty&lt;/em&gt; (1970) was reprinted by Fox &amp;amp; Wilkes (of Center for Independent
Thought which runs Laissez Faire Books) in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Machinery of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; has been both reprinted and revised. Naturally, it is the least hard-core
 of the three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An “APA,” or amateur press association based on the science-fiction fanzine concept collating
 several contributors publications without editing, it has survived since 1970 with one of
the original overall “editors” still active in it, Erwin “Filthy Pierre” Strauss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The November 1972 issue of &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt; cover story was a debate between LP
Founder David Nolan and anti-party “radical caucus” [always lower cased] founder Samuel
Edward Konkin III. By 1974, several State party newsletters contained debate and discussion
on the party’s consistency with principle. Those editors who did not defect to the New
Libertarian Alliance were all purged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Agent for Anarchy” (1971) the first Rann Gold story, preceded agorism, but the sequels,
“The Statesman” (1973) and “Dragon’s Bane” (1975), were progressively more influenced by
it, and the background history was not set until the third. All were published in &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt; and its successor, &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Weekly.&lt;/em&gt; Since those early attempts to fill
the demand for hard-core libertarian science-fiction, the Market took an invisible hand, and
Neil Schulman, Victor Koman, L. Neil Smith, Brad Linaweaver and many others actually
found aboveground publishers to pay them for the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some excellent studies were done by Dmitri Simes and his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coming Issues:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next issue, we are calling for articles on the impact of the late Murray
Rothbard (our Founding Advisor) on the Libertarian Movement, stressing his
intellectual contributions. Two obvious examples: his original synthesis of
Austrian market economics with anarchist politics; his refusal to follow most
free-market advocates into mobilization for the Cold War. (For personal tributes
 and discussion of Post-Rothbard Libertarian activism will find it in &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine, PO. Box 1748, Long Beach, CA 90801-1748.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up a working methodology to get our research going, editor
SEK3 exhumes the recently-deceased corpse of Marxism-Leninism and continues
 his series &lt;em&gt;Agorism&lt;/em&gt; Contra &lt;em&gt;Marxism&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;AQ3&lt;/em&gt; has the title, “Now What’s &lt;em&gt;Left&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;From Mises to Marx&lt;/em&gt; by David Ramsay Steel reviewed. Why “libertarianism”
failed in gravedigging Marxism-Leninism — and Agorism succeeded... And
why Chicago School-collaborator “libertarians” frantically denigrate the triumphant
 Austrian praxeologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• ...and reviews and articles not vetted, not to mention those not submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

Rothbard, 1926–1995&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;By Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In person, Murray Rothbard could be described as a Woody Allen who
had studied economics; it was no accident that one of his all-time favourite
directors was Mel Brooks. When confronted with accusations that former
conservatives had become so ideological as libertarians that they were
turning into humorless movement cogs, one had only to offer in rebuttal
the contrast of Murray with Marx, Lenin, and, for that matter, Rand. Even
the Conservative who purged him from &lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt; in the 1950s for
high deviations (refusal to sanction the State for anti-Communist crusading),
 William F. Buckley, had to refer to his victims as “Murray Rothbard
and his Merry Band of Anarchists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This personality stability and good humor have profound consequences
for what he, oft described as the Godfather of the modern Libertarian
Movement, called “This Movement of Ours.” First and foremost, it meant
that no matter how much one disagreed with him, one was not cast into
outer darkness (again, unlike Marx, Lenin, and Rand) never to be mentioned
 again. In 1977, at our most estranged over the Libertarian Party, I
described him as Darth Vader in print. Three years later he was purged
from the mighty Kochtopus by the device of taking away his token shares
in the Cato Institute, which evoked his loudest cries of betrayal. I promptly
sent him shares in &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine with the caveat that they
could not be taken away from him under any circumstances. He responded
 immediately with customary wit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothbard’s impact on libertarian (and agorist) intellectual and ideological
 development will easily fill our entire next number of &lt;em&gt;AQ;&lt;/em&gt; personal
tributes and discussion of his movement impact and the Post-Rothbard
future, if any, of the Libertarian Movement will take up at least one, if not
more, issues of &lt;em&gt;NL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two points need to be made immediately: there would be no Libertarian
Movement save for the thought and action (particularly in the 1960s) of
Professor Murray Newton Rothbard, Ph.D., and, had he pursued the same
sort of tactics he had experienced in his association with fellow students at
Columbia, or with the Randists or the ex-Communist purgers around
Buckley, the Movement that we know today would not have endured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one who finds himself more and more belonging to another, different
 movement of the future, I offer to all Movements, present and future,
the example of one who disdained to retain his leadership by any means
save superiority in intellectual combat and possession of sharper wit. I
hope that the world shall see many more of his like.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personalities"></category><category term="obits"></category></entry><entry><title>Copywrongs</title><link href="https://www.sek3.net/copywrongs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-10T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-10T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1986-07-01:copywrongs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Copywrongs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done every step of production in the publishing industry,
both for myself and others, I have one irrefutable empirical conclusion
 about the economic effect of copyrights on prices and wages:
nada. Zero. Nihil. So negligible you’d need a geiger counter to
measure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I move on to exactly what copyrights do have an impact
on, one may be interested as to why the praxeological negligibility
of this tariff. The answer is found in the peculiar nature of
publishing. There are big publishers and small publishers and very,
very few in between. For the Big Boys, royalties are a fraction of one
percent of multi-million press runs. They lose more money from
bureaucratic interstices and round-off error. The small publishers
are largely counter-economic and usually survive on donated
material or break-in writing; let the new writers worry about
copyrighting and reselling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are a very few cases of legal action in the
magazine world because of this disparity. The little ’zines have no
hope beating a rip-off and shrug it off after a perfunctory threat;
the Biggies rattle their corporate-lawyer sabres and nearly anyone
above ground quietly bows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book publishing is a small part of total publishing and there are
some middle-range publishers who do worry about the total cost
picture in marginal publishing cases. But now there are two kinds
of writers: Big Names and everyone else. Everyone Else is seldom
reprinted; copyrights have nothing to do with first printings
(economically). Big Names rake it in—but they also make a lot from
ever-higher bids for their next contract. And the lowered risk of not
selling out a reprint of a Big Name who has already sold out a print
run more than compensates paying the writing the extra fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Big Names writers would lose something substantial if the
copyright privilege ceased enforcement. But Big Name writers are
an even smaller percentage of writers than Big Name Actors are of
actors. If they all vanished tomorrow, no one would notice (except
their friends, one hopes). Still, one may reasonably wonder if the
star system’s incentive can be done away with without the whole
pyramid collapsing. If any economic argument remains for
copyrights, it’s incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crap. As Don Marquis put in the words of Archy the Cockroach,
“Creative expression is the need of my soul.” And Archy banged his
head on typewriter key after typewriter key all night long to turn
out his columns—which Marquis cashed in. Writing as a medium of
expression will continue as long as someone has a burning need to
express. And if all they have to express is a need for second
payments and associated residuals, we’re all better off for not
reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, alas, the instant elimination of copyrights would have
negligible effect on the star system. While it would cut into the
lifelong gravy train of stellar scribes, it would have no effect, on
their biggest source of income: the contract for their next book (or
script, play or even magazine article or short story). That is where
the money is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re only as good as your last piece”—but you collect for that
on your next sale. Market decisions are made on anticipated sales.
Sounds like straight von Mises, right? (Another great writer who
profited little from copyrighting—but others are currently raking it
in from Ludwig’s privileged corpse—er, corpus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of all this vulgar praxeology is not just to clear the way
for the moral question. The market (praise be) is telling us
something. After all, both market human action and morality arise
from the same Natural Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, let us clear out some more deadwood and red herrings
before we face the Great Moral Issue. First, if you abolish
copyrights, would great authors starve? Nope, in fact, the market
might open a trifle for new blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would writers write if they did not get paid? Who says they
wouldn’t? There is no link between payment for writing and
copyrights. Royalties roll in (or, much more often, trickle in) long
after the next work is sold and the one after is in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is not a producer entitled to the fruit of his labour? Sure, that’s
why writers are paid. But if I make a copy of a shoe or a table or a
fireplace log (with my little copied axe), does the cobbler or wood-worker
 or woodchopper collect a royalty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. J. Galambos, bless his anarchoheart, attempted to take
copyrights and patents to their logical conclusion. Every time we
break a stick, Ug The First should collect a royalty. Ideas are property,
 he says; madness and chaos result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property is a concept extracted from nature by conceptual man
to designate the distribution of scarce goods—the entire material
world—among avaricious, competing egos. If I have an idea, you
may have the same idea and it takes nothing from me. Use yours as
you will and I do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas, to use the ‘au courant’ language of computer programmers,
 are the programmes; property is the data. Or, to use another
current cliche, ideas are the maps and cartography, and property is
the territory. The difference compares well to the differences between
 sex and talking about sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would not ideas be repressed without the incentive (provided by
copyrights)? ‘Au contraire’ the biggest problem with ideas is the
delivery system. How do we get them to those marketeers who can
distribute them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideas are pieces of what passes for my soul (or, if you prefer,
ego). Therefore, everytime someone adopts one of them, a little
piece of me has infected them. And for this I get paid, too! On top of
all that, I should be paid and paid and paid as they get staler and
staler?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If copyrights are such a drag, why and how did they evolve? Not
by the market process. Like all privileges, they were grants of the
king. The idea did not—could not—arise until Gutenberg’s printing
press and it coincided with the rise of royal divinity, and soon after,
the onslaught of mercantilism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who benefits from this privilege? There is an economic impact
I failed to mention earlier. It is, in Bastiat’s phrasing, the unseen.
Copyright is a Big publisher’s method, under cover of protecting artists,
 of restraint of trade. Yes, we’re talking monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For when the Corporation tosses its bone to the struggling writer,
and an occasional steak to the pampered tenth of a percent, it
receives an enforceable legal monopoly on the editing, typesetting,
printing, packaging, marketing (including advertising) and
sometimes even local distribution of that book or magazine. (In
magazines, it also has an exclusivity in layout vs other articles and
illustrations and published advertisements.) How’s that for vertical
integration and restraint of trade?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the system perpetuates, give or take a few counter-economic
 outlaws and some enterprising Taiwanese with good
smuggling connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because copyrights permeate all mass media, Copyright is the
Rip-off That Dare Not Mention Its Name. The rot corrupting our entire
 communications market is so entrenched it will survive
nothing short of abolition of the State and its enforcement of
Copyright. Because the losers, small-name writers and all readers,
lose so little each, we are content—it seems—to be nickel-and-dime
plundered. Why worry about mosquito bites when we have the vampire
 gouges of income taxes and automobile tariffs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the central moral question: what first woke me up to the
problem that was the innocent viewer scenario. Consider the
following careful contractual construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Big and Publisher Bigger have contracts not to reveal a
word of what’s in some publication. Everyone on the staff, every
person in the step of production is contracted not to reveal a word.
All the distributors are covered and the advertising quotes only a
minimal amount of words. Every reader is, like Death Records in
Phantom of the Paradise, under contract, too; that is, every reader
who purchases the book or ’zine and thus interacts with someone
who is under contract—interacts in a voluntary trade and voluntary
 agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I am not worried about the simultaneous creator; although
an obvious victim, he or she is rare, given sufficient complexity in
the work under questions. (However, some recent copyright decisions
 and the fact that the Dolly Parton case even got as far as a
serious trial—means the corruption is spreading.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day you and I walk into a room—invited but without even
mention of a contract—and the publication lies open on a table.
Photons leap from the pages to our eyes and our hapless brain processes
 the information. Utterly innocent, having committed no
volitional act, we are copyright violators. We have unintentionally
embarked on a life of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God or the Market help us if we now try to act on the ideas
now in our mind or to reveal this unintended guilty secret in any
way. The State shall strike us—save only if Author Big and
Publisher Bigger decide in their tyrannous mercy that we are too
small and not worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if we use the ideas or repeat or reprint them, even as part of
our own larger creation—bang! There goes the monopoly. And so
each and every innocent viewer must be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the Market? Hardly. The entire contractual agreement falls
like a house of cards when the innocent gets his or her forbidden
view. No, copyright has nothing to do with creativity, incentive,
just desserts, fruits of labour or any other element of the moral,
free market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a creature of the State, the Vampire’s little bat. And, as far as
I’m concerned, the word should be copywrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Refer to the whole issue of The Voluntaryist if you want to know about the button thing more and read the Watner’s article. —dig.ed.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Watner seems to approvingly cite Robert LeFevre in
contrast to Leonard Read concerning pushing a
hypothetical button that would end all price controls immediately.
I first came across a version of this when Murray Rothbard
declared, at the 1969 Libertarian Conference in New York City’s
Hotel Diplomat, that if offered a button that would do away with the
State apparatus on the spot, he would “blister his finger pushing
the button.” The bold challenge was hurled, thus, not only to
LeFevre but to Read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with the dichotomy presented: first, the
actual opposition of the two premises; second, the interpretation
of the hypotheses involved and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is far less obvious to me than it was to LeFevre that one must,
to use his term, abdicate Abdication (of State power) in order to
push this magic button. Neither Read nor Rothbard bothered to
conjecture how such a button &lt;em&gt;arose.&lt;/em&gt; Suppose that a group of
agorists had somehow managed to buy up all the network and
cable television time at a certain time of day and spent considerable
 advertising funds to induce most of the populace to watch.
You are placed before the button which will run the videotape of a
George Lucas-produced grabber which rivets the audience to
their seat and gets most of them to listen to a new and improved
John Galt speech. Upon hearing the words and absorbing the
visuals, a sufficient number of people quit their statist jobs, refuse
to obey regulations and pay taxes, and possibly defend their
neighbors should they be harassed by the few remaining State
thugs. (Pacifists may drop the final consequence.) The agorists
accomplished the set-up without violating anyone’s rights. The
situation is highly speculative and, alas, quite unlikely, but
definitely possible. We now have a reasonable pathway to the
Rothbard-improved Read hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would Robert LeFevre fail to push &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; button?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at least one case can be drawn where the Button-Pushing &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt;
Abdication are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in opposition, then the dichotomy fails. Those
who are unable to construct others lack imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s explicitly deal with interpretation. Suppose I’m offered
two buttons. One button will accomplish the end above with the
specified means. The other button was connected to the White
House “hot line” and would signal my acceptance of the
presidency: in desperate straits as the State is rapidly collapsing
from massive counter-economic activity, the dying Executive and
rump Congress offer me total power (because I seem to know
what the hell is going on) to save the situation the best way I can.
I’m as convinced as I could be that they are willing to grab at
anything and will accept at least my initial edicts. In fact, due to
their experience with Friedmanite reform economists, they even
expect that most of my dictates will involve abolishing huge
chunks of the State, hopefully (to them) saving &lt;em&gt;something.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up that way, it is still too easy to take the moral path. I’m even
sure Murray Rothbard would push Button One. So let’s add one
more condition to get a bit of realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; how either group will react. In fact, we are
suspicious that we have not yet done sufficient preparatory work
and the populace may enjoy the show but there’s a good chance
not enough of them are ready to go the rest of the way. And if we
push Button One, we have blown our chance for Button Two, for
the State’s agents on hands will immediately report our “treason.”
For whatever reason, we seem to be more sure that the statists are
in dire enough straits to carry out their promises this time. Now
which one shall we press?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot speak for all voluntaryists, but I certainly hope each
and every Agorist would blister his or her finger along with me
pushing the button for the Lady of Liberty and not the Tiger of
Statism. Push the button &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; abdicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;by Samuel E. Konkin II&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most anti-political libertarian has to admit elections do
change things, even if only because they are believed and acted
upon. The most striking example in the democratic enclave of
Western society may well be the two Canadian federal elections
within the past year. And the most recent results could well portend
strong gains for objective libertarianism, grist for the activist’s mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 16 long years of Liberal (pro-U.S. centrist party, like unto
U.S. Democrats with right and left wings) Party rule, eleven of them
under the Gallic Kennedy-type, Pierre Eliot Trudeau, the West,
Maritimes, and English-speaking East-Central of Canada voted for
Alberta’s Joe Clark and his Progressive Conservative (mildly anti-U.S.,
 centre-right Party, like unto mix of British Tories and French
Gaullists with a smattering of American Liberal Republicanism)
Party. Since Quebec stubbornly supported Trudeau’s Liberals and
the Social Credit (pro-U.S., radical right party, similar to a mixture
of Birchers and populists), Clark could only muster a minority
government, though only four seats short of a majority. The
Creditistes had five seats, well, six originally until one was bought
out by the Tories (as the P.C.’s are known, the Liberals are called
“Grits”), and the assumption by most pundits in the Canadian
press was that fiery Fabien Roy and his Creditistes would prop up
their ideological near-kinsmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such was not to be. Although Trudeau was berated for his
arrogance, it was nothing compared to that displayed by Clark &amp;amp;
Co. to the Social Credit Party.[1] After dragging out the calling of
Parliament after the election to a record four months, Clark
presented a budget calling for higher taxes and more controls and
assumed the free-enterprise Creditistes had nowhere else to go and
support him. In the greatest act of political moral suicide since
Gilles Gregoire blocked the House of Commons single-handedly to
begin Social-Credit Separatism and paralyse the federal
government, the Creditistes refused to vote for the budget. The
Liberals, smelling blood, swam back from their scattered
constituencies, parties (cocktail variety), and homes to join the
social-democrat New Democrat Party (NDP) into narrowly
defeating the budget. In any heir of British Parliamentary tradition,
that constitutes the strongest possible vote of non-confidence, and
Clark promptly resigned, calling for an election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winter election, coming just eight months after the last one,
was manifestly unpopular, and Clark’s 18-cent gas tax even less so.
The Liberals regained seats in the Maritimes and Ontario, and
wiped out the Creditistes in Quebec (so much for the rewards of
morality in the political arena); the NDP further cut into the Tories
in the West. Worst of all, from a libertarian political viewpoint,
Trudeau won an absolute majority of seats and remains safe from
non-confidence motions (and elections) for the full five-year
maximum term. Ironically, Trudeau was about to step down in
disgrace when the election suddenly happened, and the Liberals
had been gearing up for the bruising leadership convention.
&lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt; (the Time-Newsweek of Canada) called his return on the
cover of its election issue: “The Second Coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a Fabian political libertarian viewpoint, the February 1980
(“Valentine’s Day”) election could be considered a gain for statism,
with the loss of the proto-libertarian Creditistes and a majority
government. Furthermore, Trudeau is the champion of strong,
central government, and will be using his prime ministry to battle
Rene Levesque’s Parti Quebec (commonly called pequistes) in the
coming referendum on “Quebec sovereignty.” This concept, by the
way, requires some twisted unraveling, thanks to Leveque’s
continued weaseling and selling out of Separatism, but it basically
allows the voters of Quebec to vote for “separatism” without
actually getting it; it’s taken as a bargaining ploy by most of the
media pundits to give Levesque a stronger hand in bargaining with
Trudeau for Provincial &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; federal rights and powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before dealing with this crucial libertarian issue of separatism, or
as the Yanks (especially the Yankees from Mississippi) like to call
the concept, secession, there was one direct blow for libertarianism
in the election. No, the very conservative Canadian Libertarian
Party (overwhelmingly minarchist, anti-communist in foreign
policy, and worst of all, anti-separatist because the strongest
faction in the PQ is socialist-liberal) got not only zero seats, but
failed to get any significant mention in the press. At least the CBC
election coverage mentioned only the four parties above and
“Others:” &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt; also made no mention of the CLP before,
during or after the election. Ah, but the Rhinoceros Party, a
Canadian variant of the “Nobody for President” campaign,
received mention on the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, government-owned and largest TV network) and
fully a third-page in Maclean’s. More importantly, quoting from
&lt;em&gt;Maclean’s,&lt;/em&gt; “While all other parties watched their slim Quebec
footholds trampled under the Liberal thumping, the Rhinocerotics
saw their total vote almost double to 110,000. “But we weren’t
worried,” confides Rhino heavy Charles McKenzie. ‘We took the
precaution of doubling our number of candidates.’ One bitter
Quebec Tory candidate, Clark aide Andre Payette, appearing on
the provincially owned TV network, Radio-Quebec, after its
election centre had been invaded by a Rhino band, confessed to
having a lot in common with Rhino star Sonia (Tickle) Cote—such
as roughly the same number of votes. Sonia, perched beside him in
her clown outfit and hanging over her accordion, could only look
up and blush coyly from under her single forehorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile, back at their east-end Montreal rent-a-hall, the Rhino
machine—basically a hippi revival, complete with
construction boots, giggling kids and barking dogs—danced
drunkenly around a giant TV screen, celebrating the 1,000-plus
votes won by a horned cousin in Calgary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calgary, brings us to the point of this article. The second largest
and second most conservative city in Alberta (and the most
Americanized, with its own John Birch Society chapter) after
Edmonton, the capital, is probably the most libertarian in the sense
most Americans would think of it, with a thriving anti-tax
movement winning plebiscites just like Howard Jarvis. All Alberta,
like British Columbia and Saskatchewan on either side, voted in
zero Liberals, and while BC and Saskatchewan voted in many
NDPs, Alberta went solidly PC, showing those Eastern bandits
what it thought of those who would steal its precious oil. Calgary
also is the home of provincial premier Peter Lougheed, himself a
Kennedy-esque type who ousted the Alberta Social Credit Party in
1972 and remained in power since. Lougheed has bloated the
Alberta Heritage Fund with oil royalties to the point where he
could probably buy the entire Canadian army should it ever be
used to invade a seceding Alberta. Would ultra-right, tax-free,
regulation-loose, anti-union Alberta secede? Undoubtedly the most
bigoted anti-frog (French equivalent of “nigger”) area in Canada,
would Alberta go separatist? &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt; seems to think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when this author was the firebrand Social Credit leader at
the University of Alberta (1964-1968), he had to look long and hard
for another secessionist, even those who liked the idea but not the
French Canadians. Then a report about five years ago mentioned
that an Alberta separatist party had been started and 500 members
had joined. &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt; reported, in the issue after its election
special, “For Albertans, it was back to the barricades, back to their
traditional sense of grievance and isolation. Having felt themselves
a part of the federal government for the first time since John
Diefenbaker’s days, the shock of being on the outside looking east
again have shoved some toward separatism. At the Canada West
Foundation, the think tank devoted to forging a new Canada
within Confederation, the telephone was ringing at 8:15 the
morning after. ‘I picked it up and someone said, “I feel totally
disenfranchised today,” ’ says administration officer Nancy
Sanford. ‘Every five minutes since, there has been another call. A
quarter of the callers are looking for a separatist party, which we
aren’t. The rest are saying they feel totally sick and they want to
voice their frustration to someone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How serious is this possibility of Alberta separatism taken? Of
course, short of shipping oil by pipeline to Montana, land-locked
Alberta has the Pacific coastline—and an equally strong separatist
pull. Again, from &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s,&lt;/em&gt; “BC IN POLITICAL ISOLATION.
And it is Perrault ((Liberal senator from BC)) who is reminding
Trudeau of events such as last week’s radio survey that showed six
out of every 10 callers in favor of separation from the rest of
Canada. ‘But usually it’s just the dissidents who call these shows,’
he philosophizes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote comes from the lead article in Maclean’s, along with a
cartoon showing Trudeau facing a battery of microphones, with an
array of knives, arrows, tomahawks and darts protruding from his
backside “. . . and I am reminded that while we face the
threat of separatism in Quebec, we must not turn our backs on the
alienation of the West . . .” Yes, the threat of Western separatism is
taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the other two Western Provinces elected only two
Liberals total (from urban Manitoba) giving an Alberta—British
Columbia “Rocky Mountain Republic” a nice buffer zone, the
battle will be fought economically, not on the battlefield. The fact
that Alberta is rich and economically free, and the rest of Canada is
suffering under austerity budgets and heavy government regulation
and taxation is the key. And it’s also the problem because there is
no firm ideological leadership in the West. Lougheed is simply a
conservative who is following the political dynamics of the
situation which leads him to the coming confrontation with
Ottawa (the federal capital) over oil controls. But he’s not fighting
for Alberta non-regulation of petroleum vs federal regulation,
rather they’re arguing how the plunder should be divided. This
could kill any principled rally against the central state..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, the link between Quebec and Western separatists
must be established. Again, Lougheed is not the medium, a symbol
of a (relatively sophisticated, to be sure) anti-frog mentality, and
not likely to win Levesque’s support. The old Social Credit Party,
strong precisely in Alberta, Quebec (and still the provincial
government in British Columbia) would have been the perfect
vehicle—but it’s at a new low in strength, most of its old
supporters supporting the pequistes in Quebec and the PCs in
Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for libertarian organization is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Apologies for name-dropping, but Prime Minister Clark was a
PM at the University of Alberta when this writer, in his pre-libertarian
days, sat as Social Credit whip in model parliament and
remembered his arrogance well toward the SC Party, then the
dominant one in Alberta politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Societies: Libertarian Alternative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are writing a Science Fiction story set
in the future. You want one or more model societies to
use as background and possibly contrast. One you
consider is libertarian. What should it look like; more
importantly, what should it &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; resemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarian-like societies have been presented by
Heinlein, LeGuin, Russell, Kornbluth, Anderson and
others. None were written in light of the recent
“explosion” of libertarian theory (since 1969); they
were the author’s idea of a free society independent of
the new scholarly literature and movement debates.
Circa 1969 even my own Rann Gold Series is obsolete.
One has the extreme of Larry Niven’s “Cloak of
Anarchy,” which resembles libertarian thought just
close enough to evoke howls of “smear” from the
positions attributed to the anarchists not in fact held
by radical libertarians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Do Libertarians Think?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to write dialogue for libertarians, you
should have some ideas of their precepts, jargons and
obsessions. I’m not going to explain the philosophy
here, just the &lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt; traits. Naturally, as individualists,
 libertarians have a great deal or variety and a
great deal of differences between them, but there are
some salients in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libertarians are morality-conscious.&lt;/em&gt; Although a free
speech, laissez-faire society is a result of libertarianism,
 libertarians are strongly concerned with morality.
Usually their libertarian position derives from some
higher precept: Natural Law, Objectivism, Christianity,
 or, in the case of the Stirnirites, &lt;em&gt;denial&lt;/em&gt; of universal
morality. Thus you could easily show a group of
libertarians in a saloon or around a campfire or in a
drawing room vociferously challenging each other in
heated debate—but turning as one in scorn on any
intruder who dared suggest resolving a disagreement
by force, then happily returning to their strenuous
arguments. Of course, some libertarians will disagree
about &lt;em&gt;this,&lt;/em&gt; and sit outside the talk sessions attempting
to achieve a mellow state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libertarians are voluntarists.&lt;/em&gt; While a libertarian
army is conceivable, and would probably be organized
as a highly efficient business company with highly
autonomous units using a high degree of independent
judgment down the “ranks,” it would exist as anything
more than a rudimentary appendix only if a clear and
present danger (large State nearby) also existed. Some
fans suggested in their fanfic a “libertarian police"
pouncing on non—libertarians, exiling them, jailing
them, or at least cutting off business with them
(including feeding and sheltering). This is as absurd
as a portrayal of a Christian medieval society with a
“Christians for Satan” club. One might portray an “ex”
libertarian society which has been taken over by
statists and corrupting the name, but they will be
recognized by many of the character is your society
(probably from the underground).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libertarians are marketeers.&lt;/em&gt; Even in the very “Left”
anarchy of Anarres, Ursula LeGuin was forced to
introduce a private press for her rebels to dissent from
the collectivist anarchist line. The vast majority of
libertarians today, even of socialistic leanings, expect
a free trade society. Most see a highly commercial and
technological organization in a libertarian society and
View the very existence of government as grit in the
gears and highly inefficient (as well as immoral).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any attempt at business interference would strike
your characters as counter-productive, competition
would be exalted, and crime against life and property
would arouse the populace immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libertarians are varied.&lt;/em&gt; While libertarians have
many rigid ideologies as well as free-form positions
there is no monolithic party line... which brings us to
the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Kinds of Libertarian Societies Are There?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;principle&lt;/em&gt; all libertarian societies are alike.
Culturally, however, one may not only conceive of
many different libertarian societies but every libertarian
 society by its nature will have numerous
subsocieties. From an SF author’s point of view the use
of a libertarian society for a setting offers the widest
latitude to the imagination. Invent any non-coercive
philosophy or religion and there’s no reason why you
cannot have several practitioners of it in your society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfectly reasonable example would be to have an
elite, Dorsai-like group of mercenaries coexisting on a
planet (a “free port” perhaps with the other planets
state-controlled) with pacifist businessmen, clannish
communal farmers, and guildish scientists and engineers.
 Throw in a libertine entertainment district,
some wandering freaks both religious and secular,
and a few refugee revolutionaries from the other
systems and presto! You’ve got more interactions,
character growth, contrasts and “conflict” than you
could possibly use, not to mention ample ideas for
humour by juxtaposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, every individual in a libertarian
society is an autonomous unit. To know one is to know
almost nothing about the rest. In another sense, there
cannot be more than one libertarian Society in the
sense of distinctly separate units with defined borders
or boundaries. Anyone can go anywhere he, she, or it
can afford or get invited. Then again, one group may
decide to withdraw from the rest and isolate them—
selves anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No Politics, No Wars, No Taxes, ...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a writer, conflict is especially important. Alas, a
libertarian society is particularly lacking in it. No
unemployment since one needs a minimum wage law
to keep people unemployed. No wars because you need
governments to wage them. No elections or coups
because there are no government leaders. No oppression
 because there are no police. No serious crime
because property is protected efficiently as with any
other business. No taxes because there is no government
 to collect or demand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are still challenges to living, over-
coming natural obstacles, making money, innovating,
personal tragedies and fights, eternal triangles and
romances, errors and corrections, inventions and
crackpottery. But if you want large scale social ills,
you’ll have to add a State or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are problems you will have to deal with
having a libertarian society bordering a statist one,
such as why the State's subjects put up with it when
they see the example of a working anarchy next door.
But one can be imaginative about such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Libertarian Societies Are Not&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A libertarian society must have come from somewhere.
 Conceivably, it might have arisen on some
alien planet never having known the State and
discovering the non-aggression principle early. One
can have some obvious drama when this innocent
society runs into their first statists—such as Terrans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it arose from our present society, then the
people must have developed libertarian behavior
modes. Note I did not say libertarian theories. In order
for a libertarian society to have developed, the
libertarians in thought must have become libertarians
in deed. This has nothing to do with signing up,
voting, or declarations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A society becomes libertarian when the populace
refuses, en masse, to obey the State, to submit under
threat, to pay taxes, to use State currency, or to accept
handouts and subsidies. This self—sufficiency will be
maintained as long as the society is, and this will be
reflected in all customs, transactions, traditions and
even the romances of the libertarians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus behavior patterns at variance with an individual
 self-governance—of children, of parents, even of
the “handicapped"—will be tolerated and could be
found—but they would be clearly noted as aberrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alien Libertarian Societies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of libertarian alien societies has
been about as common (or uncommon) as those of
Terran human ones. Asimov had an anarchist society
in &lt;em&gt;The Gods Themselves&lt;/em&gt; (though I surprised him in an
elevator by pointing it out to him); Anderson in &lt;em&gt;Winter
of the World&lt;/em&gt; (although the aliens were ex-human
mutants). Many others mention alien societies in
passing but “forget” to give them a government or
politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarianism is based on individual intelligence
(free will) and its interaction with matter (property).
Hence any beings with the smarts and material
possessions can have a libertarian society. Whether or
not they will be more or less likely to than humans are
is the subject for a nice long letter or mailing comment
debate. For starters, Anderson thought that mutants
were more capable than humans to “handle anarchy”
&lt;em&gt;(op. cit.).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ursula LeGuin has both functioning human
anarchies and alien societies in her Ekumen, it will be
interesting to see what she does with the interactions.
Other well-known authors currently of libertarian
leanings whose future works should be observed for
anarchies are Heinlein, Van Vogt, Bester, Wilson
(both), Moorcock and maybe even Richard E. Geis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros you would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; expect an anarchy from (except
inadvertently) are Niven and Pournelle, Asimov,
Herbert, and Reynolds. I don’t know what to expect of
RA. Lafferty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCLUDING DETAILS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of technical questions one might
want to follow up if building a libertarian society in
close detail. There is simply no room to delve into all
the possibilities. For example, how would a libertarian
society fight a state that appeared suddenly? What
kind of heavy philosophical debates would members
of the libertarian society get hung up on? How could
garbage be collected and murder mysteries solved?
The answers to all these is that it depends on the
context you have developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you wanting expert consulting on
libertarian technicalities, contact me at NLE. This
article was written simply to prevent the most obvious
errors and inadvertent smears (all smears of libertarianism
 will henceforth be assumed advertent!). You
may now start writing; class dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Agorists = The Anti-Utopian Visionaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;by Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perhaps a century ago&lt;/em&gt; the classic division of Anarchists into Individualists,
Communists, and Syndicalists had validity both in ease of communication and
in correspondence to reality. Twenty years ago “anarchocapitalist vs anarchocommunist”
 probably described a serious schism in Anarchist ranks undoubtedly
abetted by the Cold War mentality of factions within the State. Today there
are still divergences in mentality among those who have arrived at the need
for statelessness from many directions. The time has not arrived (if it ever
will) for the discarding of labels among &lt;strong&gt;Anarchy’s defenders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, there is no such thing as “Anarchism”. Only the extreme distortions
 caused by the existence of the State could bring one to believe that
Anarchists base an entire ideology — a vision of how to live — on the minor
adjustment of Humanity’s lifestyle to eliminate the petty annoyance of institutionalized
 parasitism. Would one base an entire theory of human life on
the extermination of cockroaches, or even leprosy or the Plague?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present society, the State is indeed a pressing problem. But those
who have arrived, for all their many reasons, at the conclusion that it must
be abolished, are precisely those whose vision is clear enough to catch a
glimpse of the possibilities of life unstunted by rampant coercion. There
will be Anarchy, and those who pursue this necessary and heroic goal are indeed
 Anarchists; but they are much more: Communists, Syndicalists, Christians,
Scientologists, Utopians, Taoists, New Philosophers,... and Agorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the most&lt;/em&gt; serious divisions of the Anarchist ranks stems from the speculation
 of what will happen to the institution of Property when the State is
eliminated. It should be obvious that the deduction of where Property arises
is important to this debate. A strong, almost dominant, view of the Property
Question among Anarchists is that Property arose from conquest and hence is
entirely illegitimate. In a society of free persons, cooperation and voluntary
 action will somehow allocate goods without the need for specific boundaries
 around the material in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketeers (agora = wide-open marketplace) do not share this utopian,
and ultimately fear-ridden, view of Property. They perceive their existence
to require material substance, and they do not draw their lines around the
narrow-outlook boundaries the bodies they chance to be born with. Agorists see
the limit of the Ego arising only from contact with the bubble of another Ego.
In short, Agorists see Property as a fact of human nature, and waste no time
lamenting that-which-is. They embrace this Truth joyfully and develop their
libertarianism toward eliminating conflict among the Individuals in Society,
and allowing each and all to expand in permissible dimensions without limit:
&lt;strong&gt;Peace and Profit!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The possibilities&lt;/em&gt; of confusion and communication breakdowns between those who
arrived from the Left (anti-property) tradition and those from the Free Market
(Centre in Europe, Right in America) tradition are bad enough from contact between
 the half-educated in both camps. The difference in terminology requires
a virtual translation in order for Market and Non-Market Anarchists to understand
 each other without feeling threatened “from Within”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of examples will suffice. To the Non-Market Anarchist, Profit
signifies some act of vicious exploitation, involving coercion and violence.
To the Agorist, Profit is that increase in material wealth arising from innovation,
 i.e., the reward for creative genius, Would any anarchocommunist
deny reward for creative genius? Would any Free Market Anarchist accept
gain by coercion, unearned plunder? The Anarchist Commonality of Thought is
there, if effort is made to cut through the verbiage to see and respect the
other’s Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem arises from the view of “Wage slavery”, as the anarchosyndicalists
 call it. It may surprise some Anarchists from the Left that
hard-core Agorists sneer at the ware System as something fitting for Medieval
Europe (or modern Russia), a hang-over of feudal organizational methods incompatible
 with high-powered free enterprise. Their Vision of Devision of
Labor foresees the “withering away” of the Worker function with the rise of
cybernetics and robotics, and a great expansion of the Capitalist, and especially
 Entrepreneurial, economic functions of Humans. The rise of the Independent
 Contractor and the Consultant are present day trends lauded and heralded
 by marketeers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is no difference in outlook. Non-Market
Anarchists see the employment of workers as “exploitation” desired and practiced
 by employers. Market Anarchists see employment as a sacrifice chosen
&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; workers with irrational insecurities and unwillingness to accept risk; as
almost compelled upon employers who would be far better served (in the account
books) by dealing with contractors who would accept risks themselves for completion
 of work projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not all anarchists&lt;/em&gt; see an end to violence, though all seek the end of monopolized,
 aggressive violence of the State. But even outright pacifism is not
exclusive to the Left Anarchist tradition. The 10,000-odd graduates of Robert
LeFevre’s educational effort have renounced defensive force to varying degrees,
willing to rely on free market processes for their defense. This &lt;strong&gt;hardly&lt;/strong&gt; supports
 the charge that Agorism is a refuge for camouflaged big-business plutocrats
 seeking to survive after a People’s Revolution (a charge often thrown
wildly at the anti-utopian idealists of the uncoerced marketplace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor are all anarchocommunists paving the way for a Bolshevik takeover, or
anarchosyndicalists harbingers of fascism (state syndicalism). There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;
statists in both camps masquerading as Anarchists, to be sure. They are recognized
 as professing the “Ideals” of Communism or Agorism, while protesting
the impracticality of achieving those ideals in the foreseeable future. Indeed,
they spend their time accommodating to that “fact of life” called the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In conclusion,&lt;/em&gt; I’ll address myself to those who ask “So what? So there are all
other kinds of Anarchists; why should we achieve any degree of solidarity?
Let us each pursue our visions isolated, and each incidentally striking our
blows against the State”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agorists, the only ones I can pretend to Speak for to any degree, cannot
 rationally see such separation in their best interest. If the marketplace
 is simply made up of those who fully understand the workings of the market,
 we should have all perished before acquiring our present understandings.
Nor are those with an elementary economic education more valuable to us in
trade and social intercourse if they insist on serving the State (like Ropke
and Friedman, two outstanding sell-outs) than those who imperfectly but
effectively see and oppose the common threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I hope we can all see that the State will be immeasurably hampered
 in facing a Commonality of Anarchists espousing all views of Human Nature.
How can we be smeared by association with the Soviet Monstrosity if unbridled
“laissez-faire” advocates are waving their black banners with glee at the TV
cameras? How can Anarchy be identified with big-business statism if unalloyed
communists cry from the barricades the slogans of freedom? And the rest of
the uncommitted world could not fail to he moved and influenced upon seeing
the future of freedom and mutual tolerance promised by Anarchy actually working
 here and now, &lt;strong&gt;in the Camp of the Anarchists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Or: The case against repeal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;By Samuel Edward Konkin, III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pick an anti, any anti.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be considered the libertarian equivalent of a
card trick. In sleight-of-hand, the object is to have the member
 of the audience choose the card you want him to, while
letting him choose whatever he wants. The libertarian trying
 to conjure up a convert—or at least a little attention—can
 load his deck in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the trick? The stage magician wants you to select
a card, any card—but from his deck. And the adept libertarian
 asks the same: select an “anti” position from the
Deck of Political Issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the “member of the audience” says he’s anti-tomato
 soup, or anti-brushing one’s teeth four times a day,
the libertarian just shrugs and says, “Laissez faire!”
Then you remind the mark that he was supposed to pick a
card from the deck, select an “anti” from political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-busing? Even the most retarded libertarian could
demonstrate that the State is responsible for busing to
atone for the sins of segregation visited upon the seventh
generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-gun? Well, this may bother some gun nut libertarians,
 but the trick, I assure you, always works. If the
rube throws you a curve, reverse your stance to catch it.
Try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sure you’ll agree we can’t get rid of all guns by
force. After all, who will get rid of the guns held by those
who are forcing everyone else to hold them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But actually, there are indeed far more guns than
people would freely produce if they had their way. And you
know who has the most guns—to be used for offensive as
well as defensive purposes—not to mention gas, planes,
neutron bombs, killer lasers, missiles, tanks and on and
on?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the audience is once again facing the
State as the obstacle to the satisfaction of their anti-ness.
The same “reverse stance” can be used whether you’re
given anti-sexism or anti-feminism, anti-pollution or anti-ecology,
 anti-war or anti-(reason for the war).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-tax? You should be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I’m really that good a libertarian magician, I
should be able to foil my own trick. Suppose I enter a parlor
where some alleged libertarian, having only read the first
half of this article, is wowing the guests with my ploy. He’s
a deviationist of some kind, so assume I am annoyed. He
decides to rub it in by looking at me, asking me to fall for
my gambit. “Pick an anti, any . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anti-repeal. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than likely, this deviationist is an anarcho-democrat
 (polite term for political-process libertarians ranging
from cuddly Roycians to fire-breathing Partyarchs). If there
is one thing every anarcho-democrat believes, one common
denominator for any libertarian who’s the least bit soft-core
on politics, it is support of repeal. Repeal of laws, repeal of
taxes, repeal of regulations, repeal of office (impeachment)—what
 libertarian could be against that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe this person has read two-thirds of the way
through this article and was expecting this. Suppose,
fiendishly, he throws it, back at me, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Say, aren’t you the guy who came up with this trick?
Yeah, that’s right. OK, why don’t you show us all how to
answer it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, a good libertarian magician should be able to
foil his own trick. A great libertarian wizard should be able
to counter the foil when used on him. So I’d answer thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘To repeal’ means ‘to enact legislation withdrawing or
nullifying other legislation.’ That is, the supporters of a repeal
 divide into two groups: those who gain by further political
 processing, and those who just want to get another law
off their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But many, if not most, laws are perceived to affect only
a small interest group in a statist society; hence, in order to
use the political process to get the law in question off their
backs, the latter group must devote resources to persuade
the less concerned to bestir themselves. The former group—politicians
 and their jackals—profit by allocating the resources
 and consuming much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The alternative is for the latter group (victims is a good
name) to devote whatever resources they have for the
struggle to protect or defend themselves while they are ignoring
 the law. Suddenly, the equation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the dead weight of the unconcerned has to be
stirred to gain resources and consent to crack down on the
law-abolitionists (counter-economists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Finally, a coalition of repeal groups, seeking repeals of
various laws, find it difficult to see the common enemy (the
State) and rather see themselves competing for the same
people, same money, same time for their particular repeal.
In stark contrast, every counter-economist is in solidarity
with every other. ‘The Man’ is enemy of the smuggler,
prostitute, dealer and street gambler alike. To fink is the ultimate
 crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Repeal, then, perpetuates the State, and even where it
passes, it leaves 99 and 44/100 of the oppression and
plunder. The direct action of counter-economics consumes
capital only for the specific purpose desired, and can never
be used to sustain the State. Every counter-economic act
takes from the taxman and regulator, and snubs noses at
their authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And that’s why libertarian are anti-repeal as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s how the trick is done. Some may call it sorcery;
 I call it consistency. For an anti? Why, you’re libertarian!
 Presto!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="theory"></category></entry><entry><title>Corporativism Revivus</title><link href="https://www.sek3.net/corporativism-revivus.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1977-12-01:corporativism-revivus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Sam Konkin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporativism Revivus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do Rollerball and Network,
the Seven Sisters and Rupert Murdoch,
Ayn Rand, Robert LeFevre, Sy Leon and
&lt;em&gt;Libertarian Connection&lt;/em&gt; have in common?
All are indicators of a malaise in the
present libertarian movement which
could very well save the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, at the tail end of the
old Rothbardianism, the libertarian
movement was overwhelmed by anti-corporation
 revisionism. Gabriel Kolko, for
his &lt;em&gt;Triumph of Conservatism,&lt;/em&gt; became as
recommended as Rand, Rothbard and
Mises to newcomers. Rothbard urged us
to read G. Wiliam Domhoff’s &lt;em&gt;The Higher
 Circles&lt;/em&gt; to study how the rich ran the
State for their own corporate—as opposed
 to free market—interests:
plutocracy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 1972, the New Left
was dead (Murray said so), McGovern
was a bigger threat than Nixon (Murray
spake again), and the Radical Libertarian
 Alliance, which had thundered against
 the plutocrats and vigilantly
sought out any taint of collaboration by
libertarians with “State Capitalists”,
had been transformed into “Young Republicans
 for Proxmire” and the “Citizens
 for a Restructured Republic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, &lt;em&gt;Reason,&lt;/em&gt; five years behind
the rest of the Movement, is only now
dealing with revisionist history. But this
time, it may indeed be time to revive the
anti-corporate crusade among libertarians,
 if for only two reasons: the position
is correct, and the time is right. Let me
back up both points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last fall, I assumed that the corporation’s
 relationship to the State was
well understood by most libertarians.
Then I heard a talk at the Libertarian
Supper Club of Los Angeles by James
Carbone, a scientist and neo-Galambosian,
 now on the First Libertarian
Church’s board of directors. Carbone’s
altitude toward corporations, in which he
was hip-deep as a scientific research director,
 was naive but honestly inquiring.
 What did the rest of us libertarians
think of corporations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my utter surprise and dismay,
Robert LeFevre and Seymour Leon, two
West Coast big guns of hard-core libertarianism,
 actually defended the corporate
 concept. When Neil Schulman
and I offered the beginnings of the Old
Rothbardian (or Radical Libertarian)
analysis, we met incredulity and resistance
 from the majority of the audience—an
 audience of mostly jaded, “heard-it-all”
 Movement types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing we could finally agree on as
a starting point is that the incorporation
and limited liability should not be enforced
 by law—but LeFevre, Leon and
others actually believe that the fiction of
“corporate responsibility” replacing individual
 responsibility would be voluntarily
 accepted in a free market. (I can’t
wait until we tackle the “fractional reserve”
 question for banks!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations are not a creation of the
marketplace. Corporations are not
joint-stock companies. Corporations are
not dodges around State regulations.
The only truth in all these myths is that
many otherwise free market businessmen
 accept incorporation rather than
counter-economic techniques—collaboration
 rather than resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint-stock company (which is a perfectly
 free market institution) becomes a
corporation only through the agency of
the State. First of all, the State declares
(against the plain truth to everyone’s
eves) that a scrap of paper (charter) has
created a new individual where none was
born of woman (or man). But this individual
 is not only without flesh, it is limited
 in responsibility—it is privileged
(that is what the word means)—as in a
grant from a king. And, of course,
charters from kings were the means by
which corporations first came about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate shield absorbs all responsibilities—like
 pollution damage to
crops, nonpayment of debts, or defaults,
and so on—right up to disintegration
(bankruptcy). And still, the real human
beings behind the fiction are scot-free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for theory—how has it
worked out in practice? Well. I’ll be
damned if I’m going to repeat Kolko,
Domhoff, C. Wright Mills, et al again.
So read the originals, or dig through
your back numbers of libertarian magazines
 to read the reviews. And take a
look at James J. Martin, a libertarian of
impeccable credentials (for example,
&lt;em&gt;Revisionist Viewpoints&lt;/em&gt;), and acid Carl
Oglesby’s latest masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;The Yankee
 and Cowboy War.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States’ central State is
controlled by a small group of men and
women—the Higher Circles, the Power
Elite, the “conspiracy”—who intermarry
 in a social strata, attend the same social
 functions and belong to the same
clubs, constitute the membership of the
major policy-making organizations:
Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral
Commission, Committee for Economic
Development, Bilderbergers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want names? David Rockefeller and
his academic friends Henry Kissinger
and Zbigniew Brzezinski (yes, “and”),
Prince Bernhard (until recently) of the
Netherlands and of Royal Dutch Shell,
Robert Anderson of ARCO, the Lazard
Freres and other Rothschild interest controllers,
 the major names of the J.P.
Morgan interests, the Kennedys, the
DuPonts, Mellons, Pews, Sulzbergers,
Sehifts, the other Rockefellers, Vances,
Helms, Sorensons, and so on. (See
New Libertarian Notes #28. “Introduction
 to Libertarian Ruling Class Theory”
by this author.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[FIXME: link to NLN]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate interests have been divided
 up along sectional lines, and according
 to degrees of entrenchment,
since the founding of the American
State (and even over the founding—see
Charles Beard’s Economic Interpretations
 of the Constitution). The Morgans
and Rockefellers fought over whether
there should be a World War I and
joined together for World War II. Then
came the nouveau riche, or should I say
nouveaux etatistes, from the West:
William Randolph Hearst, Howard
Hughes, the movie moguls, the computer
 entrepreneurs and the aerospace industries,
 The Cowboy and Yankee war
over Korea, Vietnam, Kennedy, Watergate,
 Nixon . . . here we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hearst, Hughes and Getty are
dead: surely the Cowboys ride no more.
Ah, but look past the American frontier,
to western Canada, Alaska . . . and Australia.
 And sure enough, in rides Rupert
 Murdoch. The British establishment
calls for Anderson of ARCO to save the
venerable Observer from the parvenue
publisher, but that’s alright, he’s already
 got half the tabloid market in
London. And on to San Antonio, Texas,
and then to New York...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, that’s Yankee country,
their home! Murdoch buys up the New
York Post from ailing Dolly Schiff, and
then moves on New York and The Village
Voice. The Yankees intellectual sycophants
 run around like chickens with a
lox loose in the henhouse or a college of
cardinals who find that a Protestant has
just bought the Vatican—but to no avail,
NYM Co. falls and another inter-corporate
 struggle has begun. Who knows
what politicians may be assassinated or
Watergated this time? (Murdoch supported
 Carter, so it’s Morgan Yankees
and Texas Cowboys plus Murdoch vs
Rockefeller Yankees and Sun-Belt Cowboys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we could talk about the
USSR, Inc., the world’s most self-contained
 corporation, though not the richest
 or even the biggest. Yet the Soviet
Union acts just like a company with a
very big plant and facilities (and cheap
labor force), and owns huge blocks of
shares in many Western European,
Asian and even American companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget the Seven Sisters:
these are the seven oil companies that
OPEC must sell to. There are Rothschild’s
 Royal Dutch Shell; British Petroleum:
 Texaco; Gulf; and three Rockefeller
 companies (Standard Oil before
the breakup): Exxon, Mobil, and Standard
 of California. Needless to say,
bank transactions of petrodollars go
through Chase Manhattan (David Rockefeller)
 Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough. Can no one see this? How do
we get the message through to the
masses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too late—they’ve already got the message.
 While libertarians have been clinging
 to Rand’s competent capitalist idol,
or following those “hippies of the right”
like &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Connection&lt;/em&gt;’s Skye
D’Aureous and Natalee Hall into grooving
 on the multi-national companies becoming
 too much for the national States
to handle, and others mentioned earlier
don’t even realize the problem, Hollywood
 has put out two excellent movies
portraying the possibility of the Corporation
 finally absorbing the State whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rollerball&lt;/em&gt; in 1975 showed the dystopia
starkly, with a hero who resembles liberty
 and individualism and single-handedly
 fights the enemy to a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 1976 gave us &lt;em&gt;Network.&lt;/em&gt;
Besides having excellent satire on television
 and presenting the best mass-media
 portrait of a Marxist (black and female,
 no less) I’ve ever seen, the movie
spells out the corporativist philosophy
starkly in the mouth of the head of the
network’s parent corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message is “the present forms of
government just get in the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may dawn on you at this point what
I’m getting at, and you may indeed
flinch. Would any Libertarian Party candidate
 (or half the non-party libertarians,
for that matter) not hail the replacement
of the present world States with multi-national
 corporations, thus making “libertarianism”
 the co-opt for a New Statism,
 the way “liberalism” was a century ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a way out of this mess. Counter-economics
 cannot be co-opted. Moscow
 may be ready for Rollerball—but
it’s got the world’s biggest black market—and
 black market mentality in its
people (with the possible exception of
Burma). What if the corporations could
not enforce their monopolies because of
smugglers? What if the plutocrats could
not regulate because everyone was avoiding,
 evading or breaking regulations?
 What if the corporations watched
their limited liability, privileged market
shrivel up as business moved to an honest,
 righteous and enthusiastic underground
 market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, what if the enforcers—whether
 UN police, National Guard or
Company agents—going out after the
culprits, came back with stories of how
&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is counter-economic—or maybe
 they didn’t come back at all . . .&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="theory"></category></entry><entry><title>Separatism and Quebec</title><link href="https://www.sek3.net/separatism-and-quebec.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1976-12-01:separatism-and-quebec.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Samuel E.

&lt;h2&gt;Separatism and Quebec&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose, just across the state line from
where you live, secessionists had won an election
 taking over the local government. What would
your natural reaction be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you’re a radical libertarian, you’d
probably jump in the air with a whoop! Then after
a fast jig over the imagined grave of the Federal
State, you’d call up all your anarchofriends and
tell them the good news. And then, I hope, you’d
try to find any local libertarians in the area
struggling for freedom, offer them whatever help
you could in pushing their cause on your side of
the line, and send them what you can spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how come it didn’t happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quebec is right across the border from New
York state. New York has from 1,000 to 20,000
libertarians, depending on the degree of activism
required for definition. True, most are at the
other end of the state from the province, but
for about $15 a bus ride or an afternoon’s drive,
one could get from New York City to Montréal. Yet
if there is a single libertarian in New York who
is involved with the Québec Separatist movement
beyond reading the recent election results in the
TIMES, your friendly neighborhood anarchocolumnist
has yet to hear of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not so coincidentally, the Libertarian
Party’s dead hand lies heavier on the New York movement
 than anywhere else. And probably the most any
member thought of was that since the Separatists won
the election, well, what more is there to do? After
all, who can see beyond voting a Party into power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all the rest of you libertarian revolutionaries-in-embryo
 out there may not be all that
much better. How many of you have heard that the
separatists’ Parti Québec is socialist? You can
put your hands down now. How many of you have
heard of the Parti Québec? How many of you can
see no relevance to the Péquiste (as the P.Q. members
are usually called) victory on Nov. 15 to your libertarian
 goals whatsoever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with that and work backwards. The
breaking up of a State—even just splitting it in
two—is a net gain for those who wish to see the
State abolished or even limited. After all, libertarians
 have supported secessionism since Lysander
Spooner. Even partyarchs support secessionism (in
their Platforms or other such Holy Writ). Rothbard
has written reams on national self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a Counter-Economic view, just think of the
possibilities for smuggling, monetary speculations,
tax avoidance and regulation-evasion across three
borders rather than just one (Quebec-Canada. Canada-U.S.,
 U.S.-Quebec)! And the three borders would
meet at a point in the St. Lawrence River—right next
to New York state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely this is a tremendous gain for the rational
 self-interest of every libertarian in North
America. And possibly around the world, for think
of what a shining example the Québecois—right up
against the center of world imperialism—would be to
the Welsh, the Biharans, the Basques, the Meos, the
Slovaks and Ruthenians, the Ukrainians, the Parsia,
and on and on in nearly every country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine, as socialism managed to tie itself to
wars of “national” liberation, libertarianism was the
foundation of the struggles of minority separatist
movements around the globe. Think of Juan Carlos of
Spain denouncing the subversive influence of the Rothbardeneros;
 picture movie and TV clips of hard-eyed,
uniformed guerrillas in the jungles taking their lessons
 in classical Mises and clutching their little
black books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential is, at least by now, obvious. Can
one get in touch with the Pequistes? What are they,
anyways, and how can we deal with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for the summer in Ottawa in 1967, I ob-
served a by-election across the river in Hull, Québec,
where the Ralliement Creditiste was running a strong
race against the Progressive Conservatives and the
Liberals (the socialists have no support in Québec;
they have yet to elect a single member to either federal
 or provincial legislature). Being still a proto-libertarian,
 I was a campus chairman of the University
of Alberta Social Credit Party, so I thought I’d drop
down to RC campaign headquarters and offer to assist
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the local Créditistes flattered at being
noticed, amused at my attempts to converse about our
common ideology in French; they gave me a few leaflets
to pass around and some literature. In short, they
don’t bite; they are not hard to get in touch with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the average American libertarian can restrain himself
 from remarks like “How much is that in real money?“
or “Can you speak white?” or “Sure is picturesque up
here in Kew-Beck; guess I don’t need my parka in July“,
he can probably communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously we will be in demand. The reason is
simple: the war of secession (cold or hot) will be
fought—not in Québec, or at least no longer there
being the decisive battleground—but in Central Canada
 and the United States. If the federal government
can be hamstrung by pro-Quebec and anti-interventionist
activists in the rest of Canada, maybe even sympathetic
groups starting out to Split Alberta and British Columbia
 off in the far west, Québec can win. And there is
always the threat of the Marines landing in Montréal.
(Don’t laugh; Canadians take that possibility very
seriously, and all that is needed to exert pressure on
the Péquistes is the &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; that such action may be
taken: i.e., credibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what can one expect from a Separatist
Quebec? Socialism? Yes and no. The first Separatist
 Party, formed about 1960, was leftist (I am not
even considering the 12-member FLQ even if they did
have a thing for bombs and kidnapping), and called
the Ralliement pour l’independence National (RIN).
(&lt;em&gt;National&lt;/em&gt; in French and everywhere else in the world
but American English, does not mean Central or Federal;
 the &lt;em&gt;nation&lt;/em&gt; is a supra-tribe and so a National
Party in Québec is &lt;em&gt;opposed&lt;/em&gt; to the “National” government
 in Ottawa.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the Québec wing of the Social Credit
Party rose out of nowhere to become a major voting
bloc in the federal parliament: the Railiement
Créditiste. The deputy leader of the Quebec wing
was named Giles Grégoire, an intense ideological
type as compared to used-car salesman Réal Caouette,
In great danger of oversimplification, the Créditistes
are sort of a mixture of populism, Birch-style anti-establishment
 conservatism, anti-communism and anti-banker.
 Apart from their monetary theory (like
Milton Friedman?), they are hard-core free enterprise.
Certainly excellent material for conversion to libertarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 1963 election, the RC split with the
national SC; and later Grégoire Split with Caouette—over
 the separatist issue. Single-handedly,
through an adroit use of parliamentary procedure,
Grégoire stopped the entire House of Commons from
doing anything about the Seaway Strike crisis. When
his patriotism was appealed to, he replied that he
owed nothing to Canada, which he did not even believe
 in. He left the House of Commons to start
his own Provincial Party, the Ralliement National
(I told you to watch for that word).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then along came President Charles DeGaulle of
France to infuriate his Canadian hosts and delight
the nationalists. “Vive Le Québec Librel”, the
cry of the separatists, was heard around the world.
In the next election RN got 3% of the vote and RIN
6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Liberal provincial cabinet, René Levesque
heard his call. After leading a small splinter faction
 out of the Liberal Party (and helping the conservative-aligning
 Union National back into power
briefly), he formed a Movement for Sovereignty Assn.
to lobby for a separate Québec. Then, as an election
 approached in the early Seventies, he brought the
RIN and RN into a coalition and formed the Parti Québec.
To put it mildly, with Liberals, socialists and Créditistes,
 it was a “popular front.” The P.Q. scored
24% of the vote, though it won far less seats because
of the distribution of the vote, with Liberals, UN
and RC splitting the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This election Levesque played it cool, called
for reform measures and lower taxes, and even won
the support of the federalist editor of &lt;em&gt;Le Devoir&lt;/em&gt;
(a sort of French-language TIMES) Claude Ryan. He
got 39% of the vote, and the federalists split the
rest. It was worth 68 out of 11O seats, and Levesque
 is now Premier of the province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudeau first said it didn’t matter; then
the Prime Minister said he would oppose the Péquistes
taking Québec out of Confederation by any means he
found necessary. Meanwhile, Levesque is playing moderate,
 calling for a referendum in two or three years
on the question. Needless to say, those of us who do
not believe in political parties expect him to sell
out—but then there are the radicals who just might
not let him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarianism is known to Créditistes: in fact,
I have personally corresponded with a parliamentary
assistant of Réal Caouette (a friend from Alberta).
It could use a lot more exposure—especially to the
Ralliment National but also the more thoughtful Liberals
 and even the radical Leftists if it is presented
 in a sufficiently revolutionary fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no island or coral reef in the middle of
nowhere we are talking about, but a province with a
population of over six million containing the most
cosmopolitan city in North America (eat your heart
out, New York). Yes, there is a Libertarian Party in
Québec, and of course it has made itself entirely irrelevant
 to the struggle there by attacking campus
radicals and mouthing Objectivist code phrases. Qui
est Jean Gait and who cares? &lt;em&gt;Ecrasez l’état&lt;/em&gt; would
sell—but no one is marketing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, the seeds of secession
still planted in the South, New England, the Pacific
Northwest, California, and even New York City might
sprout given the successful example just across the
border. At the very least, libertarians can give
the separatists a chorus of approval and sell their
cause to sympathisers on this side of the line. Who
knows; it might even keep you out of a draftee uniform,
patrolling the streets of Trois Riviéres and dodging
sniper bullets à la Northern Ireland?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Canada"></category><category term="Quebec"></category><category term="separatism"></category></entry><entry><title>a Libertarian 2nd</title><link href="https://www.sek3.net/a-libertarian-2nd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1976-10-01:a-libertarian-2nd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Samuel E. Konkin 3rd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Libertarian 2nd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michele Flynn Stenehjem, AN AMERICAN
FIRST: JOHN T. FLYNN AND THE AMERICA
FIRST COMMITTEE (Arlington House, New
Rochelle, NY, $8.95)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John T. Flynn was one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect three reactions to that evaluation.
 First, there will be the conservative
“libertarians” and Birchers who will wonder why
that could be considered a contentious statement.
After all, did not Flynn fight the Red Conspiracy
for his last 20 years, expose “That Man In the
White House,” and support all sorts of rightist
and McCarthyite groups in the fifties? To the
radical libertarian, hardly a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a very few radical libertarians,
knowing of Flynn’s support for political candidates
 and of his self-silencing on the War
question after Pearl Harbor in the interest of
“national unity” will raise up their hands in
horror at the embracing of this non-“purist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and by far the largest reaction I
expect, is “Who?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1939 to 1941, the single, overriding
issue for everyone in the U.S.A. was World War 2.
Should the U.S. enter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side it should enter on was never in
question, since Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria,
and Romania were “fascist”—and hence reprehensible.
 But fascist Poland was to be valued (though
not democratic Finland). And half-fascist France,
Conservative-Socialist Britain, monarchist North
Africa, Yugoslavia and Greece, and various other
bastions of “liberal democracy” evoked the sympathy
 of the American liberal press—and saving the
British empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the “Great Debate”—as the War
question battle was often called—cut across the
Spectrum. Covert fascists seeing Franklin Roosevelt
 as the American Duce supported interventionism.
 Pro-German Nazis opposed entry simply because
it was on the “wrong” side. Many conservatives,
especially Southerners, were bellicose and jingoist;
 others from the North and West were isolationist.
 The big press, TIMES on both coast, TIME,
PM and LIFE were pro-war; but Hearst, McCormack
and Patterson opposed entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While New Deal “progressives” were all for
King Franklin’s Crusade, the old progressives,
such as Sen. Burton Wheeler, Philip LaFollette,
and the “other” Roosevelts, were solidly opposed.
The Communist Party U.S.A. opposed entry—until
June 1941. Then it disseminated the most blistering
 smears imaginable against its former anti-war
allies and called for Congressional witch-hunts
against the “uh-American“ anti-war movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What of libertarians? Hell, James J. Martin
was unheard of at the time, but anti-war, and Murray
 Rothbard had yet to discover anarchy, and was
an interventionist. Chodorov, Mencken and Nock
were isolationist, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were the liberals. “Liberal”
in U.S. parlance includes Social Democrats, but
Norman Thomas, later used by the CIA in the Dominican
 Republic, and perennial Socialist Party
presidential candidate, worked as an all-but-in-name
 member of Flynn’s New York Chapter of the
America First Committee (NYC-AFC). Thomas was, in
fact, involved in Flynn’s more liberal front, Keep
America Out of War Congress. Another covert supporter
 of NYC-AFC was Chester Bowles, considered
a liberal archetype by many conservatives in the
1960s. Bowles remained in the closet most of the
time because of fear of business loss (he was in
the sensitive advertising industry)—but so did
many conservatives, such as the brothers Richardson
 of Vick Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heroism of Flynn, Oswald Garrison Villard,
 Charles A. Beard and classical liberals of
that ilk has been well-presented by New Left revisionist
 Ronald Radosh in his PROPHETS ON THE
RIGHT (see review in NEW LIBERTARIAN WEEKLY # 1,
11/30/75). The only new things Ms. Stenehjem has
to offer concerning her father’s purge from liberal
 media and blacklisting by Roosevelt was to
add the problems he faced from the infiltrating
Coughlinites, Bundists, Christian Frontists, and
even pro-administration provacateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[FIXME: link to NLW?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning the book at hand, Ms. Stenehjem
is neither hard-core nor a great writer. But her
Subject matter is Fascinating and carries the
book. More than anything else, AN AMERICAN FIRST
is the story of an incredible series of mistakes,
martyrs, mobilizations and mixed premises. And
finally, of defeat when Roosevelt finally goaded
the Japanese into their fatalistic attack on Pearl
Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the mistakes of the AFC can be attributed
 to their mixed premises. Not just the
problems of a wide “pop front” constricted strategy,
 but far more important, AFC limited itself
to direct pressure on Congressmen, and then to propaganda
 to the constituents of marginal legislators
to pressure their Representatives. NYC-AFC was
thankfully saved from direct entry into electoral
activity by its dissolution in December 1941. AFC
worked above all to be respectable, and eschewed
civil disobediance, sabotage, and active and passive
 resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-Viet Nam War “isolationists” used
all of the above, appealing directly to the masses—and
 won the critical point. And where the Student
 Mobilization Committee and peace groups welcomed
 Commies, Trots, and Maoists. Flynn shunned
association with Nazis and anti-Semites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Charles Lindbergh was unafraid to say
what was common knowledge in 1941: that Jewish
organizations and Jewish-owned media were acting,
out of a mistaken ethnic solidarity and from an
unmistaken fear of threats to themselves, as
hard-core warmongers. And although Lindbergh
and Flynn hastened to point out that some Jews
recognized that the fascist threat came from the
New Deal and not the Third Reich, the pseudo-liberals
 pilloried Lindbergh for intolerance and
spattered the AFC with guilt-by-association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to answer why the three reactions to
my embracing of Flynn are wrong. Flynn was a
liberal in the 1930s—but a “classical” one. In
fact, he came close to being a “radical minarchist”—like
 many of the modern limited government
 libertarians who have embraced the anarchist’s
radical analysis of American society while clinging
to the “minimal state” out of philosophical con-
fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn was not only pro-free market, his only
serious Statist deviation in the 1930s, while
writing “Other People’s Money.” a column for the
NEW REPUBLIC, was support of anti-trust. Rightly
he feared the corporate statists Morgan, Rockefeller.
et al; wrongly, he thought the limited state could
and should deal with them. The war issue finally
taught him that the enemy was Washington, and no
succor could be gained from that quarter against
the “triumph of conservatism“ of the Wall Street
“progressives.” Thus, almost coincidentally and
certainly fortuitously, from Dec. 1940 to Dec. 1941,
when organizer of the NYC-AFC, Flynn held an incredibly
 pure libertarian position, far more so than
any other figure in America First.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he was hard-core, cheering up the flagging
spirits, resolving to push ahead during the Lend-Lease
 and convoy defeats, keeping the faithful
pleased, the group pure, and writing tirelessly to
match the pro-War media blitz article for article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it didn’t end well. Flynn dissolved the
Committee when the bombs hit Pearl, and refused to
allow others to carry it on against a “united war
effort,” though he and Thomas did attempt to defend
 civil liberties during the War-repression. He
found only that the New Deal democratic fascists
had no use for “unity” on any terms but surrender,
and he could never sell his writings again outside
the rightist press: AMERICAN MERCURY, Devin-Adair
books, HUMAN EVENTS, a few innocuous pieces for
READER’S DIGEST. Roosevelt wanted unconditional
surrender—from the Axis and from his domestic opponents.
 If nothing else, Flynn’s martyrdom is a
valuable lesson to the modern isolationist, radical
libertarian that there is no relief from the
struggle against the State, that the price for
selling out will never cover the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For John T. Flynn fought the only good fight
available in the bleak, unlibertarlan 1940s. And
then, at least, he was one of us.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Libertarian Strategy</title><link href="https://www.sek3.net/libertarian-strategy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Samuel Edward Konkin III</name></author><id>tag:www.sek3.net,1976-09-01:libertarian-strategy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Samuel E. Konkin, 3rd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Libertarian Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the myriad programs for reform, revolution,
 emigration, and escape underground, into
the forests, in and under the ocean and to outer
space, the Libertarian Caucus Technique (LCT)
stands out for one distinguishing characteristic:
it has been observed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is not a whole-cloth fabrication
or an attempt to apply other modes of successful
anti-State action to libertarian requirements.
This paper rather puts forward the underlying
principles behind an already proven successful tactic
 so that it may be systematically applied and
used where appropriate and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all plans leading to battle, the LCT can
be thwarted, and the troops can lose themselves in
the process. Since you are fighting for the minds,
hearts and souls of others, that is what you are
laying on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to success of a Libertarian Caucus is
&lt;em&gt;strategic infiltration.&lt;/em&gt; The terms sound cold and
calculated and are meant to. Failure to trigger
the strategy at the appropriate time—regardless
of personal feelings—will blow the technique.
It’s not for the soft-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, LCT is political judo. The pivot
is the “sanction of the victim,” the always-present
vulnerable spot in the State apparatus. Like all
forms of judo, it requires the opponent coming to
you and throwing his weight. You merely adjust the
direction of his trajectory so that he lands flat
on his back, rather than on top of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That requires patience and detachment. The
strategic infiltrator can never force the issue,
nor can he initiate action (beyond setting up the
LC). He must always &lt;em&gt;respond,&lt;/em&gt; react to the issues
that the opposition gives him. Of course, he can
be incredibly adept discovering issues where others
may not have noticed them. But ego-tripping “leadership”
 just doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Libertarian Caucus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caucus technique is an old political
trick, much more prevalent on the Left in the
U.S., but cross-spectrum in parliamentary
countries. A caucus is simply a gathering of
vote-holders &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a larger voting bloc. A
&lt;em&gt;bloc&lt;/em&gt; or coalition in parliamentary countries votes
to keep itself in power. The parties themselves
go “into caucus,” but usually they have separate
internal caucuses representing their ideological
sources of strength. (Notice how close the idea
is to the “sanction of the victim.“)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservative Party of Great Britain has
a “Monday Club” of free enterprise right-wingers
who form a caucus to exert pressure on the Party
to maintain ideology in the face of pragmatism.
The Labour Party has the Tribune Group which does
the same for Leftist ideological purity. The Free
Democrats of Germany had both a Left-caucus and
a National Liberal Action Right-caucus, though the
leaders of the latter have dropped out and joined
the Christian Democrats. The Italian Christian
Democrats are heavily faction-ridden, and their
Left-caucus seeks coalition with Communists while
their Right-caucus contemplates the neo-fascists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., one could think of parliamentary
examples such as the Wednesday Club, Conservative
Study Group, Black Democratic Caucus and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Students for a Democratic Society, which
was an umbrella group of the New Left, was loaded
with caucuses: Worker-Student Alliance, Revolutionary
 Youth Movement, Anarchist Caucus, Independent
 Socialist Caucus, several Trotskyite caucuses,
 and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A caucus serves two functions: one for the
group as a whole, the other for the caucus members.
 It serves the former by keeping the caucused
 faction pacified and part of the group, and
it serves the latter by putting forward their position
 in hopes of making it the dominant one.
The first function is realistic and obviously
works, at least for a time. The latter is not and
does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caucuses which capture temporary control
of the American political parties have either gone
down to defeat (William Jennings Bryan for the
Populists, George McGovern for the radiclibs),
sold out (Thomas Jefferson for the Old Republicans,
 Abe Lincoln for the Free Soilers), Or both
(Barry Goldwater for the conservatives). In a
case by itself was the takeover of the Peace and
Freedom Party by the California “Libertarian” Alliance,
 where the CLA ended up with a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a group simply organized for taking
over a Party would succeed—except that such a
“Power Caucus” would not fulfill the first function
 of gaining the sanction of some principally
principled victims. Contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To defeat this &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; contradiction, the apparent
 one is given up. The strategists of the
Libertarian Caucus enter with the full understanding
 that they will not take power. In fact,
the &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; influence they seem to have, the better
for the strategy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strategic Goal of the LCT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of libertarian activists is the
construction of a viable libertarian society. A
viable libertarian society is a collection of individuals
 who possess the following characteristics:
 rejection of all claims to their lives and
property, refusal to subjugate their selves (egos)
into a collective, and acceptance of an alliance
with other individuals possessing the first two
characteristics for purposes of defense. Any given
individual in a libertarian society need not possess
 these characteristics; but it is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;
that a sufficient number do to fulfill the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need not belabor what is obvious at this
point: libertarianism cannot be imposed from the
top down. &lt;em&gt;Failure&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;impose&lt;/em&gt; libertarianism is,
in fact, a measure of &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt; of libertarianism.
Contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such collectives as political parties and
related ideological organizations and pressure
groups operate counter to the libertarian’s goals.
Thus, the strategic infiltrator has an incomparable
advantage if he is a libertarian: he does not
fear the destruction of the collective he is infiltrating.
 In fact, he welcomes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this point driven home, one must point
out that the short-term or even medium-range survival
 of the infiltrated group is a lesser consequence
 to the strategic infiltrator than his
primary goal: to create libertarians, to add
to his ranks of allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the strategic infiltrator employs
those tactics which foster rejection of the collectivist
 ethic, which encourage rejection of
self-sacrifice, and which raise the consciousness
of the non-aware members to see the concealed
fraud and coercion starkly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Party members are put through a trauma
where they must choose between alternatives which
they earlier felt were compatible. At one of
these crises, the member will reject membership
or embrace it without further reservation. The
latter will join the ranks of the enemy. The
former, if exposed to libertarian thought along
the way, may finally raise their consciousness
 to your level and join you, or work for
your ends on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will basically go into shock from the
trauma, and simply “Browne out.” They reject the
reality of the choice but cannot maintain the
evasion that the choice is not real. They shut
down their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Tactics for the Libertarian Caucus Technique&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactics you work out for use of the
LCT are specific to the group you are in.
Clearly, a tactic for use in the Student Mobilization
 Committee Against the War etc. will be
different from one usable in the John Birch Society.
 On the other hand, some tactics in the
Democratic Party infiltration may be applicable
to Republican Party infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s run through some historical examples
and see what worked. The first case attempted
never got off the ground, i.e., the RLA infiltration
 of SDS. The second case, the RLA infiltration
 of YAF, was incredibly successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infiltrators set up an Anarchist Caucus
 (AC) to explicitly push the hard-core, pure
libertarian position. However, the action was
really fought in the “Libertarian” Caucus, where
those who felt libertarians could work with the
conservative Statists were to be found in large
numbers. The “agit-prop” before the Con raised
the consciousness of the target group. The
literature distributed at the St. Louis Convention
 was a deliberate incitement to the “Trads”
(traditionalist conservatives)—&lt;em&gt;The Tranquil
Statement&lt;/em&gt; of the RLA, &lt;em&gt;The Match!&lt;/em&gt; from SLAM, and
Rothbard’s “Listen YAF” in &lt;em&gt;The Libertarian Forum.&lt;/em&gt;
Rothbard explicitly begins his agitation by
calling for a Schism—equivalent to “seizing the
high ground” in military terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AC brought Karl Hess to speak under the
Arch. Some trad called the cops to break up the
gathering. The AC exploited their put-upon image
and challenged Buckley to debate Hess. Buckley
refused, and the AC now had evidence to
back their claims that the conservative Trads
wanted no compromise with the libertarians. A
defection from the LC slate to the Trad National
Office slate was picked up and used as evidence
that one could not be in both camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, when &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; issue came up, the Trads
throttled back their own hard-liners to pass a
wishy-washy position on conscription to give
the LCers hope of victory “next time.” The AC
struck back with a hard-core position on the draft,
which actually got through committee with some
sympathetic help to become a minority plank.
When it became obvious the delegates were willing
 to accept compromise over schism, one AC
provocateur ignited what appeared to be his
draft card. A simple act—but a contradiction
with the compromise being voted. The resulting
polarisation, split of YAF, and formation of the
modern libertarian movement is well-known, but
the strategic infiltration is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of early attempts by myself to
convert what I observed in St. Louis into a
science brought inconclusive results—a split in
the Anti-War in Cambodia marchers, and the Anarchist
 Caucus at a Wisconsin Young Republican
Convention. A move into the Wisconsin Alliance
(a new Leftist party) showed signs of bearing
fruit but could not be completed as I left for
New York. Just to keep in practice, I split
up a YIP chapter at U.W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New York, various anti-war groups were
infiltrated, but with the exception of the War
Tax Resistors, we met with little success. The
reason is that we had no common identity with
those whom we were seeking to win over. Our
vast differences made it nearly impossible to
have the “better crowd“ see us as articulating
their positions consistently, so the power-trippers
could appear closer to them. (We did pick up a
few anarcho-Leftists at a rally when we started
a chant against a Trotskyist Speaker of “Remember
 Kronstadt! Trotsky was a butcher!”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the classic success story of
strategic infiltration, the break-up of the “Libertarian”
 Party. I followed the above formula
rigorously, with one error, though I knew at the
time I was rushing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1973, the emerging LP had created the
image of a small band of anti-politicians on
the fringes of the movement, mostly Browne-outs,
coral reefers and pacifists, impotent against the
politicians. Two years later, the &lt;em&gt;radical caucus&lt;/em&gt;
had succeeded in restoring the anti-political wing
of the libertarian movement to at least equal status
 with the politicians (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Review&lt;/em&gt;’s
“Essay Review” debate between Crane and myself),
the hard-core, consistent position was conceded to
be (or feared to be when not conceded) on the anti-political
 side, and Party members were purged,
shunned and attacked for merely having associated
with the powerful and deadly &lt;em&gt;rc&lt;/em&gt; and myself—a
witch-hunt in the classic tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TODO: Should we link with LR’s article? —dig.ed.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of how it was done are in &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian Notes,&lt;/em&gt; especially issues # 32 &amp;amp; 33;
I have no intention of repeating them here.
Those reading this publication and seeing the
events of 1974 from Hr. Royce’s view now have
the answer to their common question. “But what
was Konkin after?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TODO: Definitely link NLN when have. —dig.ed.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Costs of Strategic Infiltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One has to choose between friends, who will
not ally, and allies who just aren’t going to
make good Friends. I did, with regrets, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One has to be ready to turn everything into
a success. When the “establishment” (call it
National Office, call it Trads, call it “Partyarchy,”
 call it bosses—but make sure to delineate
a clear, strong, visible enemy) defeats your issue
for more principles, charge them with repression.
When they accept your reforms, charge them with a
co-opt—and immediately hike your demand. The
establishment can do no right—which is, in fact,
one of the truths you are trying to convey. &lt;em&gt;Do
not ever lose sight of this&lt;/em&gt;—never start thinking
that you have a chance to win the enemy over, and
that they can’t be such bad guys. Then &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;
caucus function is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One must be ready to smash what one has built.
In November 1973, the disaster of the Youngstein
campaign swelled the ranks of the &lt;em&gt;radical caucus&lt;/em&gt;
anti-Partyarchy ranks to the point where I foresaw
victory for the reformers at the next convention
in Spring. I thus resigned. (Two years later
they took over and drove Rothbard out—but without
the hard-core in their ranks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can others be trusted not to “sell out” if
they organize a “strategic Infiltration”? Well,
if they have the benefit of watchful support that
I had in the LP such as Andy Thornton, Neil Schulman,
 Abby Goldsmith and others right in the inner
circle, maybe. It’s a real risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this strategy work, say, in the Republican
 Party? I think it can, at least at the lower
levels where the idealists man the ranks of pavement
 pounders. I have no inclination to pursue
the strategy any further for the foreseeable future.
But for those with strong constitutions, high
degrees of control over their emotions, and
strong stomachs for the political sewers, you’re
welcome to the ideas here. Let me know how you
do and we can compare notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics, as the great Frank Chodorov so
well analyzed, is the conflict over plunder yet
to come. Like him, I am willing to soil my hands
in this inescapably rotten, immoral game; and
again like him, I would welcome the day when our
scorn and derision will be sufficient to deal with
politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, we shall have the free society
 for which we long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Samuel E. Konkin 3rd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oft times have you heard from Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist (YFNA) of the necessity
 of Counter-Economics, and from YFNA and
others of its perils and inherent risks. This
time I’ll lay on you a bit of its joy. This anecdote
 is true, though I’ve fiddled and omitted a
bit for “security” reasons. And it begins in the
Counter-Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the City, Los Angeles, Calif. I work
here. I’m an anarchist. (Fill in your own music.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, 10 a.m. I was working on an “independent
 consultant” caper for my anarcho-buddy
Leon. Deadline was rapidly approaching, and we
both hoped a full Sunday would get us back on
schedule. I had arrived early and was churning
out marketable productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I was under attack. Pain. Excruciating.
 Growing. I had to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it wasn’t the State this time (though,
ultimately, I suppose, one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; find it involved
somewhere!). No, it was that old debbil toothache.
O misspent youth! Visions of sugarplums danced
wickedly in my head, and my tooth throbbed in
rhythm to this savage beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, good Anarcho-buddy Leon was concerned
 for my welfare. (There goes the deadline,
he was thinking.) So we called around L.A. to
find a dentist. On a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Zip-all. Nihil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith in the Market wavering, we hearkened
to a suggestion from one of the answering services
of a guy who said he’d drive in from Glendale,
but it would &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; me... We were told that the
University of California at Los Angeles and the
University of Southern California maintained
emergency dentists. UCLA is completely statist,
so we went to USC (which was also much closer).
Leon dropped me off, and I wandered through the
corridors of the sick, maimed and hypochondriac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such sufferings—and was I sympatico. Half
the bureaucrats never heard of dentists there,
and the doctors (at least they were wearing white
coats, etc.) kept pointing out new bureaucrats.
Some efficient-seeming secretary brusquely told
me the dentist was not there, that it was a myth,
and to stop wasting my time. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had not rained (what I consider rain)
in Los Angeles for months. Today it was drizzling
steadily. I hopped a bus back to Leon’s, phoning
him during a transfer. He agreed to call UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCLA confirmed that their dentist was
equally mythological. Now we looked through
the yellow pages, calling a few who boldly advertised
 that they were open late hours and
weekends for emergencies. I guess their crystal
ball told them there weren’t going to be any this
Sunday. They were out. See you Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon, fretting at the time lost, had purchased
 a palliative. I dutifully, but skeptically,
 smeared benzocaine all over the aching
area. He swore that it would work and that he
had personally seen it work on someone who had
worked for him recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t work. Nor was anything else
working. Including me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Isn’t there anybody else?” I queried,
resigning myself to a sleepless night, a forfeited
 deadline, and dread anticipation of a
dental visit. (Yes, I have an irrational, whim-worshipping,
 utterly childish, but paranoid &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;
of dentists.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dialed one last time, an ad that looked
a bit dubious to him, open 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
7 days. It sounded very unprofessional. He
was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommended by the California Dental
Society, which had recommended several golf-players
 earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” said the female gum-chewing voice,
“the doctor will see you at his home, but he
wants me to tell you in advance it’s $30.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. Leon drove me to Hollywood, making
comments on the relatively poor neighborhood,
and what kind of dentist would be hard up
enough to take a patient on a Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helpfully suggested he might be a junkie
and needed the bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at a false-front house, the
door was buzzed open by remote control, and
“Dr. Jack” let us in, to a house, yard, and
connected garage in the back. We were to go
straight to the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All over the walls were posters denouncing
wicked qualities in food. Leaflets denounced
Coca-Cola as poison and ice cream as sugared
putrefaction. Leon, being a native Californian,
was not put out much, but I groaned. A food
faddist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc Jack came in, sat me down, looked in
my mouth, and whipped in the never-to-be-sufficiently-damned
 needle. The pain subsided. He
gave me a card to fill out and talked briefly
to Leon on the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the tooth could be saved by something
 called root-canal therapy. I said I could
care less, I got plenty of teeth, but you’re
the doctor. Just kill the pain for good. (I
suppose I am giving away the depth of my mind-body
 dichotomy here. Ah, well, anything for a
better story.) He had a pile of diplomas, I noticed,
 and Leon remarked that USC had a good
reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned, as I filled out the card,
that the California Dental Society had been no
help in finding him. He said he quit several
years ago. Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked under “employer” where I had written
 “New Libertarian Enterprises.” “What’s new
about it?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quack, about to butcher my one and
only mouth, is questioning me? OK. I’ll humour
him. Maybe he still remembers enough of his
training to get me through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you do?” he persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I work as an independent consultant. I’m
gown here from Canada on a (CENSORED BY AUTHOR)
job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added lamely, “It’s for tax purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then said, “Have you ever heard of the
Free Enterprise Institute?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no, I thought, don’t tell me he’s got it
in for libertarians? He’s actually heard of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh, that’s Andrew J. Galambos’ organization,
right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” he said, “I took six years of courses
before I split with him three years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy anarchoshit! An anarcho-dentist! I
was having my tooth fixed in the ever-lovin’
Counter-Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Leon rapped with Jack about Galambos,
while my anesthesized mouth was uncharacteristically
 silent. Doc Jack told us he hadn’t paid
taxes in four or five years. Considering he got
$140 more from me for less than half an hour of
“root canal therapy,” he’s a good example to us
all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave us a brief attack on how soft-core
the Dental Society was on preventative (as opposed
to restorative) dentistry, and I gave him an NLW
and he Xeroxed the LIBERTARIAN SUPPER CLUB BULLETIN
 I was carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that explained why he was working Sundays;
 he believed in the Market. Faith and health
restored, I left to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it did get me thinking. The next time
some libertarian needs me in the marketplace, will
I be available? (I put in a solid week of overtime,
 and we got everything out, by the way. Happy
ending.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;by Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the libertarian movement
  is a libertarian society. Where 
else does a movement move but to its 
goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must follow, therefore, that if a 
libertarian society has formed, the 
libertarian movement has reached its 
end. It has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is the beginning of a 
series the author plans to distribute to 
various publications—in various appropriate
  styles—of the libertarian 
movement concerning the direction of 
that body of people and thought for 
the next phase of its maturity. Underpinning
  the series lie the assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new libertarian society is present; 
the new libertarian society must be 
fully self-conscious for both its full 
utilization and enjoyment and its self-preservation
  and growth, and the new
libertarian society is a good goal, 
worthy of getting and keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these assumptions need verification;
  none are presently held by 
libertarians, with the exception of the 
last. However, if the first two are 
accepted, the third requires re-evaluation.
  Why? One is no longer talking 
about a quasi-utopian ideal “out there” 
which is &lt;em&gt;defined&lt;/em&gt; as good, but rather a 
real entity which is now open to 
examination and observation as to 
whether it is indeed good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next article in the series will be 
primarily concerned with the enacting 
of the second assumption, the raising 
of the libertarian consciousness concerning
  their own society. It will do so 
by empirically demonstrating the first 
premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent elucidations and answers
  to challenges will complete the 
fulfillment of this second premise. 
Once the main body of libertarians 
accept those two premises in whole or 
part, the third one will become open 
to debate: “What hath we wrought?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is a glimpse of the 
future of this thesis—where will it lead 
if and when it is verified. It is written 
for a select audience of avant-garde, 
highly “movement-conscious” libertarians
  who should grasp the arguments 
readily. Thus, when the position is 
presented, orderly, sequentially, and 
painstakingly to the general populace 
of libertarians, it will already be anticipated
  by our readers and they will be 
ready for its tactical deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one hears the hint of the strategic 
in this, one hears well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Growth of Libertarian Consciousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest, most primitive libertarians
  had an excellent consciousness.
  Josiah Warren attempted to 
create a separate anarchist community,
  to both show the world how well 
anarchy worked and to enjoy the 
benefits of living in the superior 
society. Because of the faulty economics
  of the early individualists, it was 
not sufficiently an improvement over 
the external society and remained 
unviable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lysander Spooner supported secession
  to bring about libertarian societies—the
  secession of black slaves 
from white owners, southern whites 
from northern whites, and western 
silver-coining society from eastern 
gold-dominant bimetallists. Since all 
these moves were crushed, one will 
not know if viable communities could 
have seceded. But it is significant that 
Spooner himself did not secede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin fucker abandoned 
thoughts of living his egoistic anarchist
  values over a period of time, 
becoming a gadfly social critic of the 
external society, and finally giving up 
in despair and exiling himself in 
France. And with that act, libertarianism
  went into its Dark Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No accident is it that Ayn Rand revived 
 libertarian morale by creating—at
  least on paper—a viable libertarian 
community in Galt’s Gulch. Of course 
Mises had to work out the economics, 
Nock and Chodorov had to keep the 
anarcho-individualist insights alive 
(though with deep cynicism) for Rand 
to re-synthesize. But Rand wrote a 
blueprint, made sympathisers think it 
could really work, and recruitment 
shot up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the 1969 split from the 
Right, libertarians attempted to live 
their ideas. One of the most ambitious
projects was Preform—an attempt to 
build a Galt’s Gulch on an artificial
island in the North Sea. Confiscation 
of the ocean bed by the surrounding 
states broke up that group, with the 
hard core attempting to find their 
retreat within the U.S.—but in remote 
areas (Vonulife). With no viable market
  and isolation of the vonuers from 
even the libertarian community, they 
self-destructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anarchozionist searches for the 
promised Gulch continue to attract 
hopeful libertarians to coral reefs and 
Caribbean gambling dens. Since basic 
new libertarian principles of market 
are ignored by these projects, they 
fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened in 1969 added the 
needed ingredient to make the libertarian
  society possible in the here and 
now. And it was provided, ironically, 
by those who are most often accused 
of escapist fantasizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Separation of Libertarian Culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969, at the time of the St. Louis 
split, a culture without economics or 
political philosophy met an economic-political 
  movement without a culture 
or societal consciousness. At the same 
city on the same weekend, the Young 
Americans for Freedom Convention 
and the World Science Fiction Convention
  occurred—with considerable 
crossing by delegates back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Libertarian Caucus called 
their bulletin TANSTAAFL and described
  the traditionalist-dominated 
National Office as “a bad Wizard.” It 
was less the introduction of SF as of 
&lt;em&gt;fannishness&lt;/em&gt; that gave the libertarians a 
rudimentary self-consciousness and 
cohesiveness. And this self-aware 
grouping split amoeba-like, to form its 
own “movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a young neophyte plunged 
into the Libertarian Movement, he or 
she found that there were progressive 
stages to go through. One read libertarian
  SF and objectivist novels, listened
  to lectures or tapes of them, 
picked up history of the movement 
and found out who the Big Names 
were, and joined or quit groups, clubs, 
organizations, and social gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is a direct parallel with SF 
fandom. And the more one “got into” 
the Movement, the more alienated 
one would feel with external society. 
Finally, pressure built up for highly 
committed libertarians to choose—become
  full-time libertarians or return
  to some form of assimilation with 
external society. The first choice led to 
agorism, the second to politics, and 
the inability to choose—the tension of 
seeing no alternative—led to the 
Brown-outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These phenomena deserve — and 
will receive—a separate writing. We 
are, as I have said, looking ahead to 
the consequences of the analysis, not 
the analysis itself. What is needed yet 
to deduce the conclusion is to define 
what we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Meaning of Libertarian Movement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many libertarians reject the very 
idea of being grouped in a collective. 
Some perfectly consistent, hard-core 
libertarians reject even the label libertarian
  because of the fear of being 
associated with others with whom they 
have small differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course they can choose to be 
hermits and they can deny all their 
ideas so they cannot be labelled 
(except as “anti-idea”—there’s no escape
  from labels short of destroying 
language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, few libertarians 
would flinch at being ( ailed “members 
of society.” And society is recognized 
as a plural concept in modern times: 
American society, Soviet Society, etc. 
One talks of Jewish society within 
European society, or Parsee society 
within Indian society, and so forth. 
What defines a society requires much 
more space, so it wall be left to subsequent
  articles. Suffice it here to say it 
implies similar cultural and philosophical
  ideas (not necessarily ethnic), 
and above all, the &lt;em&gt;consciousness&lt;/em&gt; of the 
societal individuals that they belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s tackle the 
concept of “movement.” All “movements”
  have a goal—to transform the 
society they live in. When they have 
done so, it will be a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; society. Most 
movements explicitly assert this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarians are unique in that they 
will not attempt to compel a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; 
change in the society they are in. They 
will leave some alone who freely (and 
perversely) choose to reject membership
  in the libertarian society. This 
then, is the big step in my logic. A 
libertarian society, except by the most 
improbably accident, will co-exist with 
non-libertarian societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hold—if that is true, where do 
we draw the line? &lt;em&gt;How many people must 
the Libertarian Movement reach to create 
the Libertarian Society?&lt;/em&gt; 10,000? 100,000? 
A million? A hundred million?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parsees number around a hundred
  thousand; the largest coherent 
society (not counting overlordship 
over smaller societies) in the Soviet 
Union is less than a hundred million. 
By those limits, the libertarian movement
  has already passed the lower 
limit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the Libertarian Movement 
has created a Libertarian Society, then 
it has succeeded. It has reached its 
end. It is . . .finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The End of the Libertarian Movement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of the above 
sketchy analysis begin to hit home. 
The final task of the libertarian 
movement is to complete the consciousness-raising
  of those identifying 
themselves as libertarians into thinking
  of themselves as a separate, real-live
  society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, that’s the penultimate task. 
For when that task is accomplished,

&lt;p&gt;Three Views: Toole, Samuel Edward Konkin III, and Edward H. Crane III&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invaders from the State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;By Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Libertarian Party is the vehicle of an invasion
from the State into the ranks of the libertarian movement.
 Its defenders, true to the State’s need for mysticism
 and contradiction, cry the LP is the practical
strategy for obtaining the free society; failing that, it
is another tactic, to be tried and tested with other
tactics; failing that, it is an educational tool, to lure
converts as a step to hardcore counter-economic activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LP is None of the Above. It is a vicious instrument
 of the State. For libertarians, it is immoral, impractical,
 uneconomic, strategically unsound, and
praxeologically debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of statism is deliberate mysticism,
calculated to gain the acquiescence of the oppressed
or “the sanction of the victim.” In order, to obtain
this “authority,” or legitimization of immoral actions,
 it creates meaningless forms to bedazzle the
masses—big juju! Such was the divine rule of kings,
such was nationalism, such were the emperors and
czars restoring the dead glory of Rome. Such, too,is
the game of democracy. The rule is to withhold violence
 but jockey for the use of acceptable, legitimized
violence. Those who disputed over the reins of power
were called, in Hanoverian England, parties to the
dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A political party, then, is a collective whose overriding
 purpose and reason for being is to seize control
of the State for plunder and coercion for its cause.
(Restraint of short-term plunder—liberalism—is one
possibility.) All claims to the contrary are buncombe
and cant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “Libertarian Party” is a pure contradiction—if
&lt;em&gt;libertarian&lt;/em&gt; means anticoercion and thus anti-State.
Those who openly join it proclaim their allegiance to
a “secret gang of murderers and thieves”—dropping
the secrecy. And so proclaim themselves immoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most North Americans have an inarticulate understanding
 that politics is a nauseating power grab. Five
out of every eight eligible rejected their vote in 1974,
preferring not to soil themselves in the game. These
people respond positively to an image of libertarianism
 as a vehicle to a Society Without Politics, and
they get confused by and hostile to urgings to register
and vote for a position that believes in neither registration
 nor voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, many voters are browbeaten and intimidated
 into voting by State-enforced propaganda laying
 unwarranted guilt trips on the reluctant voter.
The same pleas as justify conscription are heard:
“Duty! Honor! Country! Save Democracy!” An attack
 upon this cant relieves such people and causes
them to look favorably on the movement not requiring
 such petty self-sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LP turns away the vast majority hungering for
a consistent libertarian position. It is thus an exceedingly
 potent, practical weapon—for the State!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of dollars are wasted by
libertarians who donate time and treasure to the
bloated coffers of the LP. Not even Nelson Rockefeller
 could afford the lavish $6.50 per vote squandered
by the Tuccille for Governor Campaign of New
York’s Free Libertarian Party in 1974. And Rockefeller
 hires &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; campaign workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a shining example of market efficiency, the Libertarian
 Party is a great argument for bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stand of LP defenders is to claim that at
least politicians can use the party as a stepping stone
outward. But in fact, the LP obtains such people only
as they see the party approaching power. The professional
 Machiavellians do not care to whom their allegiance
 is due, only who can pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all the ranks of the LP are made up of idealists
 unaware of alternative activist opportunities, and
the vast majority of new converts would not vote if
the LP did not snow them into it. The turnover is
large (nearly 50 percent a year in New York, for
example) and most of the ex-members “Browne-Out,”
 rejecting politics and often more fruitful forms
of activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the LP either remystifies the statist process or
neutralizes the State’s opponents. Again, a most winning
 strategy—for the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent researches reviewed in &lt;em&gt;Laissez Faire Review,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Libertarian Forum,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Review&lt;/em&gt; have
pointed out the psychological necessity of conditioning
 submissive responses to authority as a prerequisite
to power holding sway. The LP teaches the “libertarian”
 to submit his will to the collective and execute
decisions he opposes for the “will of the majority”
and the “good of the party.” Parliamentary procedure
 teaches him frustration, wheel-spinning, and
abandonment of market-organization. Backroom
deals, backstabbing, and power blocs teach him survival—in
 a State. None of the party activities are calculated
 to reward initiative, individualism, or risk for
profit. And the LP needs a monopoly, for if it is to
win—the overriding necessity—it cannot tolerate a
split. Thus is collectivism reborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus, when all is summed, would the State remain
 triumphant should the party thrive. Already the
LP discards its idealists for the Machiavellian backs
in its leadership, in preparation for its role. The
Libertarian Party stands five-fold condemned as an
invader from the State, a Trojan Horse, a Saruman,
a Judas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we free ourselves, we cannot preach the freeing
 of others without rightfully gaining their mocking
laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Libertarian Party must go—now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

Konkin, 3rd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That Bread Is Mine, Too (2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part 1 of this article, Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist noted the inordinate
 difficulty that libertarian gurus have
had in defining that which is due the victim of
a crime. Without a simple and sure understanding
of justice, one is lost in deciding complex
questions like: “What are oppressed people due
after a revolution?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFNA pointed out that the fundamental libertarian
 axiom leads immediately to the corollary
that a person is entitled to the following: his
lost property or equivalent market value, cost
of apprehension of the Violence Initiator (VI) by
his protection agent, and the market interest
on the value lost for the time it was out of
his hands. Full restitution, but no more. Any
further imposition on the VI is violence initiated
 against &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which confirms the propriety of
this position is its market practicality. It
is simple to define in any specific case what
is due a victim by simply consulting the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another serendipity. The longer
the VI eludes your trusty protection agent,
the higher is the cost of apprehension, and
the higher his restitution. But even if the
Insurance and Protection Company does nothing
until they are tipped off, he is still racking
up interest for the involuntary loan. So he
has a strong market incentive to turn himself
in and cut his losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the VI resists by naked
violence an assault by p.a.’s (“You’ll never
take me alive, marketeer!”), his restitution
rises enormously. Now he owes restitution to
injured p.a.’s as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the stickiest question of justice 
a has to face is: What of death?
Murder most foul, or even manslaughter. What
value is a human life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, another human life is all YFNA can
come up with, being somewhat mortal himself.
But, more importantly, why not let the victim
decide it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your insurance policy, state what you
want. The execution of your murderer because
you believe in deterrence? OK. But what about
the father who rather have the VI support
his family? (This, by the way, is a basic
position of many tribal codes of justice.) And
what of the idealist who wants a foundation
financed to continue the work he was living
for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, we believe in subjective value
theory, don’t we? To be consistent, then, we
must allow each potential victim (i.e., you) to
decide his own value—or whatever lesser quantity
he will be forced to settle for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to the questions YFNA posed at
the beginning of this essay are now clear. When
the State collapses, the Statists will be
brought to justice by those sufficiently motivated
 to do so. Claims will be handled by the
arbitration and protection agencies. They will
be decided on the simple premise of libertarian
justice: full restitution. The Higher Circles
will have such an enormous debt that they will
be stripped of their holdings, which will be
sold for restitution. Then they will be confined
 to restitution work camps for the rest of
their days, unless the market decides on an incentive
 system to increase their output by offering
 them eventual freedom. Lesser Statists
will have less claims against them and lose less
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacifists naturally need enter no claim if
they wish their oppressors to get off. Native
inhabitants who can present a reasonable claim
for land stolen from their ancestors can regain
their property. Peasants who had their land
confiscated by the State can regain it—a truly
meaningful and just “land reform program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, libertarianism has the answers
for those who apply their God-given or Rand-inspired
 reason to the questions. And if they
ask for their money back, they will get it to
the penny—er, gold milligram, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can get what’s coming to her—but
 only the libertarian way. If someone tries
to sell you another way, look out for his free
lunch and hold on to your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;That Bread Is Mine, Too (1)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the State was smashed yesterday
 morning. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, everybody will go his/her
own way and make oodles of gold. Some of it
will be spent on protection agents and arbitration.
 And we shall be ever-vigilant
against the return of the State!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are we going to do if someone
wants his money back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a question is far from academic,
for one’s view of justice seems to determine
one’s revolutionary tactics. Robert LeFevre,
 the anarcho-pacifist, pursues a
purely educational route because he has
foresworn the use of defensive restitutive
force. What else can he do? Murray Rothbard,
 enamored with “temporary” political
expedients, pursues popular fronts with
rightists, then leftists, then partyarchs.
With his “double restitution” or “restitution
 plus punishment” theory, he finds himself
 allied with the Penal Institution
crowd regardless of other alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand seeks unlimited restitution,
and since infinity can only be achieved
mystically she must resurrect a government—and
 does. John Hospers once wrote
an article for REASON criticizing all libertarian
 theories of justice and choosing
the “lesser evil.” Needless to say, his
strategy operates the same way. It’s called
politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist
 assumes he has made his point.
But he remains bewildered at the confusion.
It seems to him that libertarian justice
is blindingly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before he troubles you with the
obvious, let YFNA justify taking up your
time once more. What if somebody wants her
money back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if someone walks up to you and
says, “David Rockefeller has taken a million
 dollars from me through the State’s
intervention and I can prove it! What
should I, the brand-new libertarian, do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be your answer? Will it be
the same to an Indian seeking relief from
centuries of white-eye long-knife rip-off?
How about Mexican peasants and Bircher suburbanites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, you are properly motivated. Let’s
start out with that fine old libertarian
mainstay, the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; axiom. Remember that
libertarians believe that everyone has an
absolute right to life and property. Fine.
Now Blue Meanie snatches your stereo system
 and a complete set of Beatles’ records.
You discover Mr. M in rapture on his living
room floor. You and your trusty protection
agent have followed the sound of blaring
speakers and you confront him. Old Blue
calls his p.a. and it’s off to arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the arbitrator! And he quickly
ascertains B.M.’s guilt. To what are you
entitled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, as I have said, is blindingly
obvious. Your property! After all, isn’t
&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; what you have the absolute right to?
As a libertarian, how can you disagree? Of
course, if you believe that it has become
the thief’s property by his foul act (a la
LeFevre) you would have given up and not
wasted your time on restitution anyway. But
otherwise, you are clearly entitled to that
which was yours—which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; yours, come hell,
high water, or a plague of statists, if
you are a hard-core, property-loving libertarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s spell it out. You are entitled
 to the stereo system and record collection.
 Anything else? Well, you’ve got
to move it back, so Blue Meanie either hauls
it back under the p.a.’s watchful eye or pays
to have it done. What about the p.a. and
Arbitrator Fineguy? Again, their fee should
be paid by the miscreant who incurred the
cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have your stereo system and
records back, and a record was scratched!
Blue pays for replacement at market value.
It took a day to capture him. All right,
charge him 1/365th of the market rate of
interest (for you) that it would have cost
to have borrowed the money to replace your
machine and your collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now mix in a highly competent Insurance
and Protection Agency. Upon notification
of the Violence Initiation against you, they
verify it and promptly replace your loss.
They then pursue and capture the villain,
prove him guilty, and get their cost and the
cost of your loss out of him. If he can’t
pay—or won’t tell where his loot’s buried—there’s
 always the restitution work camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smooth, efficient, moral—the mark of
the free market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should more be extracted from the
Blue Meanie? Punish him and teach the dastardly
 villain a lesson!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. First of all, full restitution
 (property replacement plus apprehension
 cost plus interest for time loss)
of what’s yours is all you are entitled to.
To get more is to take away from another.
TANSTAAFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you use force, that’s theft.
On &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; part. Hence, by a simple application
 of the fundamental libertarian axiom
we have defined both the minimum you are
entitled to—and the maximum as well. And
lo and behold, they coincide. No broad area
to approximate in, no confusion or fuzziness.
 A sharp, clear, unique answer. For
you unregenerate neo-objectivists, A is A.
You are entitled to that to which you are
entitled. For anarcho-Austrians, it’s
wonderfully praxeological. It’s true and
it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what do we do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CounterCampaign ’76&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last issue Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarchocolumnist
 (YFNA) sketched the last six years
of the Movement’s history again, this time focusing
 on strategy. The failure of all tactics
used until now, with the exception of the somewhat
 arduous Counter-Economic approach (hard
work and all that) was noted, and the Party heresy
 was pointed out as the most blatant failure.
But also noted was the drive for exhibition on
the part of many libertarians, a desire for visibility
 in a Public Campaign. Really, about
the only positive thing the Party ever claimed
for itself was that it attracted people by public
 campaigning (a false claim, by the way—the
Party has yet to &lt;em&gt;convert&lt;/em&gt; one person that I know
of, usually getting its memberships from old
LAers, NBIers, and reader-converts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the problems involved
in a political campaign. First, the Party must
be a monopoly with individuals subjecting themselves
 to compromise or outright sell-out to
unite behind a candidate. Why? To get him a
chance of winning. Why? To take office, of
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the next problem. A libertarian
 in office is another politician with
power to oppress us. Either he has the power
and refrains from using it (threatens us) or
uses it (coerces us). Nobody can be trusted
with that, clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who could we all agree on without sacrificing
 our principles? Behind whom could
students of Murray Rothbard, Robert LeFevre,
Ayn Rand, Leonard Read, Joseph Galambos, Karl
Hess, Robert A. Heinlein, El Rayo, Natallee
Hall, and Harry Browne unite? Nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what candidate can libertarians
even draw from our ranks with enough popular
appeal to bring large numbers into his campaign
that we could then use all our libertarian
wiles on to radicalize? Nobody again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the 1974 election for Republicans,
Democrats, American Independents, and Peace &amp;amp;
Freedomers. 62% (5 out of 8, figure counters)
voted for Nobody. Clearly, she is the most
popular candidate, the favourite for 1976.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who? Why, Nobody, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at her advantages! (I cannot refer
to Nobody as her, actually, since it is not
true that Nobody is female; but it is also
false that Nobody is male. So as courtesy to
feminists, I use the feminine. After all, who
cares if Nobody is offended?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody would give up her power if elected.
Nobody is free from being a focus for factional
strife. Nobody already commands large support
from the people. (Witness NLA’s brief Vote for
Nobody campaign and Sy Leon’s previous League
of Non-Voters activities for instruction in
great publicity at next to no cost.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the seriousness of the Office
of the President, Nobody would stand for a
whimsical, witty campaign to woo the wary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody would fail to seduce the new converts
 into Statism. And Nobody would fail
to have yet another “cult of personality”
spring around her. Blacks and rednecks, feminists
 and male chauvinists, the poor and
the wealthy, the fannish and the sercon,
ex-liberals and ex-conservatives could all
identify at once with Nobody. Who else can
make that claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, speaking of the campaign, I can see
it now. “Nobody in Congress was against
Taxes in ’76. Vote for Nobody!” (Great
around April 15.) “Nobody can represent
your interests in government. Nobody for
President!” “Nobody deserves to live off
your hard-earned tax money. Nobody’s our
Man!” (Or woman, person, sentient, thing...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, dear reader, Nobody can
hold more than one office in the U.S. Nobody
 for Congress! Nobody for Senate! Nobody
 for mayor! Nobody for governor! Nobody
 for dog-catcher...whoops, almost forgot
 about the limited governmentalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get carried away (yeah!) with
the whimsy, such a campaign is kicking off
this year in several stages. On July 4,
Counter-campaign ’76 will be announced to
the libertarian movement. Want a franchise
in your area? After all, even if we have
a State Committee in your area, you could
always set up a Congressional District Committee,
 county committee, assembly district
committee, or whatever. There’s plenty
for everyone. All the National Committee
asks is that if you re-publish &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; ads in
publications we haven’t covered (or put
our your own handbills), split the take
with us 50-50. Otherwise we will send you
a “letter of authorization” for you to
show to local statists with no hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get fast, fast relief from political
anxiety. Nobody can’t sell out! Countercampaign
 ’76 may even have a National Nominating
 Convention in 1976. Best place would
be in Kansas City the week before Labour
Day. Some 10,000 SF fen are expected to
be at the Hotel Muehlebach to hear the
Worldcon guest of honor—Robert Heinlein.
Libertarians and sympathizers will be
highly concentrated there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Chairperson, the State of Virginia
unanimously nominates Nobody for President!”
Cheers, balloons, kick lines. (Feminists
may have male kick lines, if they wish. Nobody
 won’t mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, delegate credentials will
be &lt;em&gt;sold,&lt;/em&gt; blatantly. (Sounds like the regular
 conventions to me—Ed.) After all, Nobody
 is free from corruption. And this being
 the era of Watergate, nobody is free
from scandal and smear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you are, hard-core person. The
problem I posed at the beginning of this column
 is solved. After all, I could not just
carp and criticize without having a positive
plan of action. Nobody would expect that
from me! And remember, you can vote for Nobody
 in the convenience of your own home.
(Send your name and address to the editor of
this publication if you are interested in
either campaigning for Nobody or/and wish
to be a delegate.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Libertarian Strategy (1)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In six years the Libertarian Movement has
learned a lot of lessons. While libertarian
theory continues to evolve and grow, the basic
ideology of 1969 remains valid. In fact, libertarian
 theory has reacted to the stimulation of
the swings and jolts from conflicting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that we are not condemned to relive it,
let’s review our history. As of December, 1968,
libertarian strategy was directed either toward
influence of the conservatives or conversion of
the independents. It was wholly educational or
retreatist. Robert LeFevre’s Rampart College,
Leonard Read’s FEE, Joe Galambos’ FEI, Nathaniel
Branden’s NBI, F. A. Harper’s IHS, and Frank Chodorov’s
 ISI were all educational institutes. The
VonuLifers, Atlantis group, and Oliverites were
seeking escape. Except for the LIBERAL INNOVATOR’s
 leafletting of the Cow Palace in 1964, no
libertarians were involved in a political campaign
 except as deviationist individuals. Many
supported Nixon in 1968, but they were clearly
of conservative leanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very victory of Nixon and sell-out of libertarian-conservative
 modest goals soured these
“campaigning individualists.” The rise of activist
 organizing as an alternative to political
campaigning and the seeming possibility of New
Left revolution attracted the campaigners to a
plausible alternative. Libertarians organized a
caucus within YAF with results we all know. In
December 1968, Rothbard and his small group of
radical libertarians—Block, Tuccille, Childs.
et al.—moved to bring libertarianism into SDS
and the New Left. The Radical Libertarian Alliance
was formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969 the right-coalition tactic exploded
in St. Louis. But within a month the New Left-alliance
 tactic also shattered in New York. To
both the Libertarian Caucus and RLA leaders’ surprise,
 the result was the formation Of independent
 Libertarian Alliances across the country,
with the RLA and SIL central organizations becoming
 just “tendencies.” SIL adapted, becoming
a clearing house to the more scattered locals.
RLA turned briefly from a revolutionary group to
a political campaign group in late 1971, and
the Citizens for a Restructured Republic promptly
died on the campaign trail of 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduation from universities began to decay
the campus-based libertarian alliances from 1970-72,
 and the LA’s began to replant themselves in
the straight communities. Eventually they would
exhibit themselves as Supper Clubs. Libertarian
Churches, or just meetings (e.g.: Gary Greenberg’s
NYLA). These were sound roots being set, but
hardly the spectacular, “shake-the-world” activities
 of the 1969-71 period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More escapism offered itself (Minerva, Abaco)
and the educators kept educating. Many libertarians
 pursued more valuable long-range activities,
combining their business or professional careers
 with libertarian advocacy: running businesses
 on agoric bases, pursuing journalism,
academic research, and even television and
radio (Lowell Ponte, Ron Kimberling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many libertarians also turned inward with
incessant psychology sessions and in-group
self-criticism. This was the Movement as reflected
 in 1972 in, say, NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES,
and which could be pieced together from RAP,
LIBERTARIAN FORUM, REASON, ACADEMIC ASSOCIATES
LETTER, VONULIFE, FREEMAN, SIL NEWS, PACIFIC
LIBERTARIAN, and many local newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in December of 1971, the political
campaign heresy arose again. To put it mildly,
Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist
was hardly an impartial observer of this weed
in our garden. But even then it seemed Obvious
to me from where it drew its appeal. First,
the need for a public “mass movement” visibility
 of many libertarians who were otherwise
quite sound on doctrine. And, second, there
were a lot of newcomers who had not “learned
their lesson” in 1968 and were confused enough
to believe that freedom can be imposed, i.e.,
“voted in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Libertarian Party should have collapsed
as fast as the CRR, since its popular vote was
so far below the number of eligible libertarians
as to show its rejection and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was obvious in N.Y. and Calif.,
the libertarians in the rest of the country
were too scattered to realize their true
strength (about 100,000, according to the lists
of the time, with less than 10,000 voting for
Hospers). Also, the electoral fast shuffle of
Roger MacBride diverted attention from the
overwhelming rejection of the LP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other libertarians campaigned for Nixon
(believe it or not), McGovern, Schmitz, and
Spock; and I have even heard of one or two who
voted for Linda Jenness (Trotskyite). Most libertarians
 didn’t vote, and Sy Leon’s League
of Non-Voters got excellent coverage on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1973 was the year of the LP. The most
viable Opposition seemed to be a radical faction
&lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the LP, though again this was misleading.
The radical caucus (RC) was firmly rooted in
the anti-political libertarian tradition, and
nurtured by all the Movement outside the Party—from
 LeFevrians to Brownians, and even a token
Galombosian!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as a real live political campaign
occurred in 1973, disillusionment began and the
rc’s ranks began to swell. Many partyites
simply dropped out immediately. The re broke
away at the state and national LP conventions
of 1974. By Spring of 1975 only the smallest
state parties on the E. Coast had not suffered
a large split, some “splits” involving nearly
the entire party. Significantly, those who
bolted were often the top activists, newsletter
editors, and theoreticians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long, painstaking construction of
a free society via a Counter-Economy cannot
be short-cut then. But, it may yet be argued,
 is there no way to harness this deep-seated
 drive to campaign publicly, and to
draw in the new recruits that the Goldwater/YAF
 and McGovern campaigns did? Is there no
such thing as a “pure” campaign which can get
all the benefits of the LP electioneering,
but avoid the deadly problems of monopoly organization,
 power-tripping, and, ultimately,
being Judas Goat for the State?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there is Nobody we could run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(next month: Counter-Campaign ’76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carrots And Sticks 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last issue of SLR, Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist decided to toss
some carrots of praise to neglected W. Coast
libertarians and to rest the stick with which
he beats various deviationists. But the coastal
regions of the U.S. have received more than
enough good press coverage. Let YFNA’s roving
eye cast itself on Middle America, that paradise
 promised us by the Prophet Murray, the
Profit Incarnate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado, of course, was gifted (or cursed,
as you will) with the Nolans. But how many of
my friendly neighborhood anarcho-readers know
that one of the truly great libertarians of all
time still lives high up in the mountains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James J. Martin was a hard-core Stirnerist-type
 free market anarchist back in the dim,
dark days of World War II. He fought the draft
and the war with brilliant revisionist history
from the beginning. Martin’s REVISIONIST VIEWPOINTS
 contains essays from the old RAMPART
JOURNAL of Robert LeFevre that are still pace-setters
 in libertarian historiography. Recently
Jim appeared at a libertarian conference which
ran concurrently with the ill-scarred Dallas LP
convention. He may yet return to liven up the
pages of the journals of the modern Movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up north, in Illinois, Joe Cobb prowls. I
have much quarrel with Joe’s present Partyarchist
 actions, but in the sixties he put out a
great little journal called the NEW INDIVIDUALIST
REVIEW: A Journal of Classical Liberal Thought.
In it Murray took cudgel to minarchists, and
Austrians battled with Friedmanites. Joe’s
own chapter of the Radical Libertarian Alliance
was humorous, though perhaps unintentionally,
since he worked for an alliance with ACLU-liberals
 while the rest of the RLA was trying
to embrace the New Left. Whatever degradation
Joe slips into these days, his fame and value
has already been vouchsafed by history, which
is more than the rest of us can safely assert
about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In Barry’s Back Yard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona was the home of the original Student
Libertarian Action Movement, once described by
this writer as the “Weathermen” of the libertarian
 movement. SLAM’s classic battle with the
police on the U of A campus won them accolades
and collections for a defense fund around the
country. Alas, SLAM is gone, after a brief split
into SLAM and “North American Libertarian Alliance,”
though Fred Woodworth and Conrad Goeringer have
gotten together in the modern MATCH! to got their
left-deviationist way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralph Kerner brought the Libertarian Caucus
home from the ’69 YAF-con in St. Louis to La.,
and he and Evan Soule have been fueling the flame
of freedom there ever since. Evan went on to
create the Committee to Legalize Cold, a strange
animal in the libertarian bestiary of front groups.
After all, it actually succeeded in achieving its
goal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lone Star State once boasted Scott
Tips and Mike Holmes, with their HARD CORE NEWS.
“Hard Core” is still the highest exclamation of
approval in the Movement, and the famous Hard
Core sweatshirt is a rare collector’s item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Holmes has since sunk into Partyac, and
Scott has Browned out and moved to Southern California,
 but their legacy remains. Over at
Sul Ross State College, Tony Warnock teaches
“logic,” his name for the basic libertarian principles.
 Tony was once at the U. of Wis. with
YFNA, and gave Free University classes in Praxeology
 while YFNA roused the rabble a bit more
crudely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in Wis. is Don McKowen, trying to liberate
 minds in Milwaukee, a truly Herculean
task. Many a libertarian leaflet has been passed
to the unsuspecting masses by Don, and many of the
Rationalist Church of America objectivists have
been shaken out of their views by his Stirnerism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Deep South Folks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Browned out in Georgia, but still
watching us with some interest, is David Rosinge
Dave’s original SOUTHERN LIBERTARIAN MESSENGER
was a brilliant Rothbardian beacon in a branch
of the Movement which once predominantly Randist
and Banneristi. Dave’s activism brought about
the first two Southern Libertarian Conferences,
the second of which featured YFNA routing Mike
Holmes and his attempt to get a libertarian part
going in the bayous and magnolia. Dave has also
been into revisionism, and the only ISOLATIONIST
pamphlet was written by him and printed in NLN
for the now defunct radical caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down at the south end of Alabama teaches a
university professor by the name of Steve Halbrook.
 “Crazy Steve” was one of the great deviationists
 of the Movement, and today’s heretics
 pale in comparison. Today I regard him wit
nostalgia, remembering his articles (like “Classical
 Utopianist Anarchism vs. Leninist Libertarianism,”
 and his urging us to consider Mao
a libertarian) as something a critic could really
sink his teeth into. While his Vanguard Party
thankfully never got off the ground, Steve was
instructive to us in showing how libertarians
should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all Middle American libertarians have
faded into the Shadow World of Mundanity. Still
plugging away in Pa. is the Society for Individual
 Liberty of Don Ernsberger and Dave Walters.
While the coasts never did get into a SIL frame,
preferring libertarian alliances of a local nature,
 most of Middle America knew of other libertarians
 only through their SIL NEWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One neglected area of interest is Canada.
During the heyday of the Libertarian Alliance, a
group put out an occasional journal in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, called THE SKEPTIC. While the zine ha
faded out, it briefly gave hope for the expansic
of libertarianism into some of the more outflung
areas of the world. Currently, revival of activity
 in Ontario and Alberta gives us hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other bright comets soared across the
libertarian skies in the early seventies in the
Middle of the Heartland, and with the upcoming
collapse of the LP and its stifling influence
and rigid conformity to outworn institutions, we
can hope that a general renaissance is in the
offing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(What about the E. Coast? For those readers who
are interested in YFNA’s views on that subject,
a quick subscription to NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES
will bring NLN 40 and “Farewell to the East,”
where that is well taken care of.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abby Goldsmith, another dropout from
state level LP leadership, has been active in
the Movement for many years in Conn. and Fla.
She is a regular contributor to such publications
 as NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES and SOUTHERN
LIBERTARIAN MESSENGER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin, III, is the editor
of NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES, the Movement’s most
outstanding monthly magazine. A doctoral
candidate in theoretical chemistry at NYU,
Konkin plans a move to the west Coast this
summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: NLN 40 wasn’t published until after (it was also NLW 88-89, the fifth all-sf ish) and contained no such material. But it might’ve been published somewhere else...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carrots And Sticks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading over past columns for SLR, Your
Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist notices
that they have been uniformly negative. Now
YFNA is not at all that sort of person who is
gnawed upon by a general hatred. So let the
brickbats flit out of this dark corner, carrying
the corpses of the deviationists they struck,
and let a few kudos be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since SLR is East-Coast-oriented, let me
start by bringing to your attention some Western
libertarians who have been all-too-neglected.
Robert M. LeFevre, for example, shines in the
anarchofirmament with Murray Rothbard, but not,
alas, with the same magnitude in this longitude.
LeFevre has an excellent journal (LEFEVRE’S
JOURNAL, of course) which is free of both deviationism
 and big words like “deviationism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be passed on to your reactionary parents
and read with enjoyment by them, but gives a
thrill to this wild-eyed bombthrower as well.
The only thing I disagree with the estimable
grand old man of Western libertarianism on is
his pacifism, which, when compared to the Partyphilia
 of some other mentors of our Movement, is
like comparing a cold to cancer. And if your
libertarianism is objectivist-based, watch it.
He will mess with your mind without you even
noticing before it’s too late and you may be
too far gone! (LJ, Box 2353, Orange, Calif.
92669, contribution of $10 suggested)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even-handed Lloyd Licher could be credited
with single-handedly keeping the Calif. libertarians
 in alliance since the Browning out of the
great Dana Rohrabacher. Lloyd runs the Libertarian
 Supper Club of Los Angeles; and every month,
the Movement gathers at the Taix Restaurant to
recharge their intellectual batteries with another
 speaker (and fill their anarchobellies
while they are at it). If you want to meet a
lot of libertarians in L.A. quick when you visit
or move there, write ahead of time to Lloyd and
send a couple of bucks so he can mail you his
newsletter and let you know when next they gather
well in advance. (Libtn. Sup. Club of L.A. Newse
letter, Lloyd Licher, 12536 Woodbine St., L.A.,
Calif. 90066, $1.50/year until the postal rates
go up again)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dare I forget John Yench? John 15 a reporter
 for the ANAHEIM BULLETIN, a mild-mannered to
boot. Ah, but when he slips into a telephone
booth, out comes...another Free Enterprise Forum
(libertarian conference, to which he kindly invited
 me last year, to speak, etc.) and maybe
another issue of CHRISTIAN LAISSEZ FAIRE! What?
“Christian”? Yes, and hard-core anarchoagorist,
too. Did he ever check his premises, you ask?
Yes, and he found a big cross over them every
Sunday. I find John indispensible as a contact
with a whole body of people outside the decadent,
unbelieving East and a healthy antidote to the
Conservative Christian quasilibertarian Foundation
for Economic Education. (CHRISTIAN LAISSEZ FAIRE,
Box 772, Anaheim, Calif. 92805. About $2 per
year, last I heard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seymour (Sy) Leon is a hard-core activist
who is also a real live entrepreneur. Sy has
taken LeFevre’s old Rampart College and turned
it into a profit-making Operation. He has been
advance man for Harry Browne, spreading the message
 to those on whom it will do the most good.
He is the instigator and chief honcho of the
League of Non-Voters and has received publicity
for the Libertarian Movement with next-to-no-investment
 and no vote-chasing that the Partyarchs
 would eat their hearts out for. He has so
integrated theory and practice (or should I say
preaching and profit) to make me eat my &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt;
out. (Seymour Leon, Box 11407, Santa Ana, Calif.
92711)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Bates is somebody I just had to
like. He got YFNA to autograph every copy of
NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES he had in his collection.
Chris is also from the Commonwealth (Britain in
his case), and a fan. Of perhaps more import to
the reader, Chris was in the thick of the San
Diego Ten (or eleven, I lost count) Tax Rebellion
Case. And he won. And he could be deported at
any time (like me, for example) without trial
or any other of those statist’s lulls of security.
Chris is like a lot of other “immigrants” I know,
who had this dream of finding a land full of
heroes and Good Guys and, when they found them
scarce, became them to fulfill their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although gone the way of all-too-many anarchomarriages,
 that of Sy and Riqui Leon has been
the biggest boon to the Calif. Movement for several
 years. Riqui was the Dolly Madison of the
Movement, throwing parties every so often at their
Orange County house. Recently she has been prominent
 in defending Women’s Lib from a libertarian
perspective against Arch-Chauvinists such as Murray
 Rothbard. Riqui has also played den mother
to many a libertarian growing up a bit slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I leave Southern Calif., let me not
slight anyone, but simply affirm that there are
many libertarians I know well enough to exalt but
who have not the general fame for their less persistent
 endeavors (generally due to working for a
living, an affliction found rarely on the E. Coast).
And there are others of fame that do not enjoy my
personal knowledge, such as Joe Galambos, Natallee
Hall and Skye D’Aureous, El Rayo and Naomi Gatherer,
 and Lou Rollins, whose good and worthy efforts
will someday earn them a more adept chronicler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us move up the Coast to the neglected
Northwest and stop briefly in Oregon. In Portland
 you will be utterly unable to find, since he
is a confirmed recluse, someone of libertarian
bent who cares little enough for “The Movement”
*bow, scrape*. In fact, he is the fellow who
taught me to write in asterisks like this *praise,
praise* and set a revolution in style and literature
 throughout Science Fiction fandom with his
SCIENCE FICTION REVIEW. Richard E. Geis is passing
through his middle age, but remains young of heart
and Spry of brain, and will probably unfailingly
put out some sort of fanzine that will make me drop
all my activities and labours when perusing my
mailbox and finding him. And have me seek some
nice corner complete with couch to curl up and
read. So his reviews are infallible in telling
you who to read and who not to, though granted,
only for form and style. But if Dick is cavalier
towards content, his unflinching eye will observe
for you who’s saying it well for us and them, and
who is botching it. And as his famous “Alter Ego”
revealed in WORLDS OF IF, he is a lover of “Romantic”
 fiction, that which is written for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;
and not for the literary critic and his set.
(SCIENCE FICTION REVIEW, P.0. Box 11408, Portland,
 Ore. 97211. $4/year)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still further north, in the Washington area,
we find lurking one Joseph Michael Sharp, Mike to
his anarcho-friends. Besides trying to get Libertarian
 Alliances going on Washington campuses, and
keeping campus papers hopping with columns, Mike
tried lighting torches for Ludwig von Mises, even
putting out an issue or two or WERTFREI, a journal
of praxeology. When last heard from, Mike was
Browning, but I assume not for long. He is being
persuaded to grace the pages of NLN with reports
from that Dark Area of our communications, and
perhaps he will be seen in SLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we leave the West Coast, let us not
forget to cast an aloha over the waves. Although
the PACIFIC LIBERTARIAN is gone, Jerrold D. Dickson
 and his FREE has the Movement in Hawaii relatively
 pure and lively. Jerry is also a fan, and
is building a libertarian alliance of some sort,
not scorning our New Libertarians. Hawaii has
always been a hotbed of activism, with a libertarian
 radio station being driven off the air
and libertarians being busted in a Census Resistance
 case, the only such bust from the great Census
 Resistence organized by SIL in 1970. I’m
sure it’s a great comfort to Jerry that I expect
him to follow in their footsteps, but perhaps he
will tread with greater care. (FREE, Box 2776,
Honolulu, Haw. 96803. $5/yr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, says the faithful reader, the West
Coast and the East Coast are filled with the
great and the good. What a pity that the Middle
of the Continent has such a dearth of wise and
true! Hah, replies YFNA. Just wait until the
next issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Anarchozionism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it’s Abaco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the earliest days of Ayn Rand’s influence
 over the Libertarian Movement, frustrated
activists have given up on their efforts to reform
 or revolt against the American State to seek
the promised Gulch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960’s, a group composed primarily
 of engineers and technologists worked on
a plan to construct an island nation on a shallow
land base of the North Sea. Preform agreed on a
tiny, nominal government, a free port status which
would thrive on free trade between Britain, Norway,
and Denmark. Individuals who had been into education
 and political action (the LIBERAL INNOVATOR,
leafletting the Cow Palace GOP convention) gave up
and published PREFORM-INFORM backing the escapees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the British seized the pirate radio stations
 operating outside their territorial waters.
Oil was discovered in the North Sea, and Britain,
Denmark, and Norway promptly carved up the sea
bed. The Preform crowd either Browned out or
went into escapist trips such as becoming nomads,
troglodytes, or wilderness dwellers. They sought
“invulnerability to coercion”—or vonu—and
PREFORM-INFORM became Vonulife. Recently it
sputtered to a halt, and the paranoia freaks
drifted back to civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Operation Atlantis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Operation Atlantis. Again the
anarchist ocean bed was the site, and a platform-island
 was to be constructed in the Caribbean. A
group gathered in Saguerties, N.Y., took over a
motel, and built a boat. Again they published a
newsletter, and started a commodities operation
(real goods bank) called ATCOPS which took silver
deposits. They even began their own money system,
the Deca (10 grams of silver).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boat sank, and prospective sites were
nationalized, but they still are plugging away in
Saguerties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Michael Oliver and his New Country
project, which eventually decided on a Pacific
coral reef named Minerva. Perhaps the goddess of
wisdom drove the men involved mad for their hubris.
As soon as concrete plans were formed, Oliver
split with the rest. A hardy individualist who
actually went to the reef to photograph it and
lay claim by homesteading was burned by organizers
 when he returned, and the ship that arrived
in N.Y. to carry a load of anarcho-immigrants never
sailed. It just sat in dock and leaked. The comical
 King of Tonga then laid claim to Minerva and
was supported by the less funny states of Fiji and
Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it appears that the Bahamian secessionists
 of Abaco are interested in American backing
and are even willing to listen politely to John
Hospers. But their aims are to set up a state of
their own. The Bahamian state has deported Hospers
as a dangerous Subversive and seem ready to act
to keep their citizenry enshackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can It Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villain in all these plays has been the
State—always ready to move against the opening of
a free society anywhere. But sometimes, dear Brutus,
 we must not look to the stars but to ourselves.
 Why hasn’t the State’s intervention been
assumed from the beginning? After all, these were
libertarians leading and organizing these plans.
Was it not the very frustration with the State’s
omnipresence that lead them to desperate measures?
Why should they believe that the very institution
willing to follow them home, into their pockets
and bedrooms, would suddenly go “hands-off” because
 they crossed some imaginary line on a globe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand’s shrugging Atlases at least faced
a crumbling state, one which was becoming too
weak and incompetent to find and destroy their
embryonic free society. It is self-consistently
obvious that if those who make the statist society
 work abandon it and devote their efforts
to a free society, the State will fall and the
free area will function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But without these people and conditions? A
is A, but suppose you don’t have A? Ayn herself
has never backed a single new country group, to
her credit. My conclusion is that if the promised
 land seekers continue to pursue their Zion
despite a dismal record in practice due to demonstrated
 errors in theory, they don’t need
Rand, Rothbard, or, for that matter, Konkin or
Royce. Szasz and Branden may offer more concrete
assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, anarchy begins at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Revisionism Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly summarized, the study of revisionism
should teach us this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The raison d’être of the State is theft;
that is, acquiring wealth by political rather than
economic means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Those individuals whose wealth depends on
coercion rather than free trade will use all their
wealth necessary to control as much of the State
apparatus as other groups also competing for such
power allow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Such individuals (the power elite, plutocracy,
 “conspiracy,” or “ruling class”) maintain a
common front for statism, but must inherently divide
when some of their interests are attacked by the
state mechanism for the gains of other plutocrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the railway companies supported
the regulation of transport for cartelization. As
cartelization grew, “progressives” advocated govt.
intervention to correct the original statist intrusion.
 The Morgan financial-industrial Eastern
interests supported Theodore Roosevelt and ousted
the McKinley regime so that Roosevelt could institute
 antitrust action against the Midwestern Rockefeller
 interests. Rockefeller backed fellow Ohioan
William Howard Taft, who used the same weapon against
 the Morgans. Morgan then used Roosevelt to
split the Republicans and backed Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War 1 saw Morgan interests heavily invested
 on the Allied side and in danger of bankruptcy.
 Against Rockefeller opposition, the Morgan-Warburg-Rothschild
 grouping of international financiers
 brought the U.S. into the war to bail out
their investments. Rockefeller backed “isolationists”
 such as Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., and with the
support of the quasi-libertarian populace ousted
the Warmongers in Congress in 1918, and Wilson in
1920.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the war, the intellectual community
split, with proto-libertarians such as Albert J. Nock
and Oswald Garrison Villard attacking Wilson and his
new “court intellectuals” for selling out “liberalism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert M. LaFollette lead the Progressives
against the Morgan-interest war. He went down to
crushing defeat in his 1924 presidential race,
dying finally a true enemy of the power elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapidly running down a list of presidential
contenders and the foreign policy each stood for, we
find in the Rockefeller-interest camp: Harding,
Coolidge, Hoover (and Pacific warmonger Stimson in
his cabinet), Wilkie, Dewey, and, of course, Ike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Morgan-interest camp were the following:
Cox, Davis, Al Smith, Roosevelt, Truman, Stevenson,
and Kennedy. Two of the latter were “coalition”
candidates with support from people outside the
Eastern-Midwestern “higher circles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War 2 was fought when the Rockefellers
were bought off by a Pacific war by the Morganites,
who were pursuing an interventionist European policy.
With the “Cold War” setting up Imperial colonies for
all the major statist corporations of the U.S., the
Morgan/Rockefeller split was “rationalized” (Gabriel
Kolko’s term).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950’s, new money emerged in Texas
(oil and computers), South Florida (land and Space),
Southern California (entertainment and aircraft),
and the Pacific Northwest (aircraft and munitions).
These nouveau-riche were termed the “Cowboys” by Carl
Oglesby in contrast to the Eastern “Yankees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John F. Kennedy was a Morgan Yankee, with LBJ
his Cowboy running mate. Richard Nixon was a Calif.
Cowboy with Henry Cabot Lodge his Rockefeller-Yankee
running mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the Yankees was most blatantly
exhibited between 1964 and 1974, the decade in which
they were most threatened. During this time, Cowboys
ran the U.S. presidency but Yankees ran the country
and literally drove from office every Cowboy contender.
When Johnson acquired the presidency through Cowboy
assassination (the CIA is Yankee-run at the top via
the State Dept. and appointed directors, but the
agents.are largely Cowboy-leaning), the Morgans were
toppled. Then Goldwater’s defeat of Nelson Rockefeller
and Scranton put the Cowboys in control of both major
parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Cowboys, as Ralph Fucetola of N.J. has
pointed out to me, are the most established, socially
acceptable Cowboys. So the Yankees joined forces with
them, using their Media-University-Bureaucracy Complex
 (MUBC) to crush Goldwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the place to recall the FDR use of ideology
 to topple his opponents (also, Roosevelt’s running
 mate in 1932 &amp;amp; 1936. Cactus Jack Garner, was
archetypically Cowboy). It brought about a near-coup
by Morgan-DuPont interests, who backed a fascist plot
(See “The Cellophane Conspiracy,” by David Rosinger
in NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES #28). Franklin aborted the
move and mended his fences with his backers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldwater’s major sin was an appeal to ideology.
As was often explicitly stated in the “intellectual”
attacks on him in 1964, Goldwater was unleashing “radicals”
 who would overturn the existing social order—the
 same sin the Morganites accused FDR of in 1934.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ousting of Dean.Burch as GOP national chairman,
 ending Goldwaterite control of the party machinery,
put the Rockefeller Yankees back in control of the
Republicans. In 1968 the humbled Cowboys accepted
Yankee Spiro Agnew as running mate for tame Cowboy
Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Yankees went after Johnson and
dumped him for Yankees HHH and Ed Muskie. Morgan
interests, as usual, Opposed Pacific Front imperialism
while supporting NATO-European interventionism. Rockefeller
 interests were pro-Pacific Front (hence Nelson’s
support of the Indochina war down the line), but anti-Johnson
 Cowboy domestic control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon’s victory in 1968 led to immediate attack
by the Trustbusters on Ling-Temco-Vought, a major Texas
Cowboy conglomerate. However, the Southwestern (Haldeman
 and Ehrlichman) and Florida (Rebozo) Cowboys rode
high in the first Nixon administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGovern’s victory in the 1972 Democratic convention
 veered the party too far to the “radical” (which,
to the Establishment, means “those-who-threaten-our-rule”
 and is applied to left, right, and libertarian
regardless of other views). The most liberal Morganites
hung on with Sargent Shriver’s replacement of Tom
Eagleton, but others defected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, after crushing defeat of semi-radical
candidates, Yankees sabotaged a Cowboy president. Using
local political payoff records and tax dodging
which are usually forgotten when a politico moves
up to a higher office, the MUBC actually drove out
Agnew and replaced him with Rockefeller Yankee
Gerald Ford (Agnew himself was originally a Rockefeller
 Yankee but was acquiring a new Cowboy base).
The remarkableness of this feat is not that they
managed to find and publicize Such records and evidence
 but that the MUBC Suppressed all the available
counter-revelations which existed for every other
politician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Watergate was in fact set up by
Yankee agents to entrap Cowboy operatives is really
irrelevant, though interesting. Such activities are
always going on, and again, it was the revelation
and constant hammering away at the Cowboys’ culpability
 and the Suppression of Yankee malfeasance
which is the notable achievement of the MUBC.
Bringing Nixon to the point of impeachment was the
greatest exhibition of Yankee power, and contrasted
with the Cowboy crudity of relying on assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point that this article is written, the
Yankees are about to confirm Rockefeller as vice
president. With David Rockefeller running the financial
 system of the U.S. and much of the world,
and Nelson as president (after Ford’s predictable
removal) and commander in chief, separation of power
ends in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cowboys are on the run. Howard Hughes,
who controlled Nevada Republicans through Governor
Laxalt, was driven out of the state and out of the
country. Texas oil is threatened by throttling of
oil depletion allowances (acceptable to the entrenched
 Eastern “old money” oil interests); The
Space Program cancellation broke several Cowboy companies
 and Lockheed is on the dole. H.L. Hunt is
dead, his Libya venture seized by a coup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, George Wallace is alive thought not
kicking, and he remains a Cowboy hope for second
spot. And Boeing’s Senator, Scoop Jackson, has a
coalition with organized labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cowboys are also considering a Reagan/Buckley
 third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in U.S. history since 1864,
the question of whether or not there will be future
elections becomes debatable. In fact, the scenarios
to Step the Rockefeller Yankee power consolidation
seem more “far out” than the takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One scenario is a Libertarian Party/Reagan Republican/Wallacite-Bircher
 coalition (exactly analogous
 to the Free Soil Party/Abolitionist Whigs/American Party
 coalition that formed the GOP in
1856) for a radical/Cowboy attack on the Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kennedy’s withdrawal, the Morgans seem
strangely quiescent and willing to let the Rockefellers
 run the Yankee show. If the Democrats put
up a Jackson/Wallace ticket, it will either be bought
out (Jackson at least seems purchasable) or crushed
by the MUBC. Or will it? Can even Such a huge propaganda
 syndicate overwhelm the average American’s
innate distrust of the Rockefellers? The present
indications are that around 80% of the country opposes
 the Rockefeller takeover. So will Rocky
allow an election in 1976, after, as I believe:
he ousts Ford?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer will be, if he thinks he can win,
there Will be an election. If David Rockefeller
estimates that cancelling the Constitution would
incite the populace to back radicals, he will force
Nelson to face election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would oppose him? Jackson/Wallace would
be a Cowboy ticket. On the other hand, another
McGovern-type semi-radical would split the Democrats
and probably win it for Rocky. A Democrat Split
also gives a Reagan Conservative Cowboy group a
chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering who is in ascendancy at a
given time, observe what industries are getting
govt. contracts, Subsidies, quotas, and tariffs.
Who is “Out”? The interests losing govt. contracts,
being trustbusted, receiving bad press, or attacked
as “threats to the ecology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the newspapers and newsmagazines, and work
out the games the “higher circles” are playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarian economic and moral theory are necessary
 to understand the option of a free society,
and revisionism is necessary to understand the
nature of the state, its class support, and its
mechanics. To complete the integrated outlook, a
rounded libertarian must apply his morality, economics,
 revisionist history, and.other fields to
a goal-directed strategy. But that’s another
article!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Agora v. Arena&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the world around you look to a hard-core libertarian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in general, it looks much like it does to everyone else... although
freedom’s advocates
 do fend to have a greater than their statistical share of quirkery and kookery. Libertarians
 are amused by comedy, saddened by tragedy, sweetened by candy, and soured by ill
fortune. Yes it is rumoured that when we are cut, we, too, bleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one difference that we share with perhaps only the devoutly theological and
the Marxist. We have a comprehensive social structure. When we look at a newspaper story, we
integrate the facts into our social theory and draw conclusions. We see mighty and powerful
forces, and sweeps of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-read non-initiate sees facts around
him, but they are confusing and not of a piece.
They make only limited sense and are explained by
ad hoc theories read in yesterday’s column by some
pundit who has already forgotten how he interpreted
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assassination? First reaction: how tragic!
Second reaction: how senseless of that person to
act that way. Third thought: he believed such and
such and therefore... or, he did not seem the type
to kill somebody, so the poor man must be insane!
It is here that the radical libertarian departs from
his fellow man... and not just because he does not
believe in insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the libertarian will end in agreement
that the act was private and motivated by whim of an
irrational man. But before that conclusion, he
will investigate other possibilities—possibilities
that the act &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; motivated by (perhaps not so enlightened,
 but nevertheless) self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will ask: &lt;em&gt;cui bono?&lt;/em&gt; Whose good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariffs are not passed because of the great
belief of the masses in the “American system” or
“Economic Nationalism”—that is just the sales
pitch. The cotton tariff exists because the cotton
agricultural plutocrats financed the lobbying, bought
those who would be, and paid off editors to sling
propaganda and twisted workers to vote against those
who would oppose them. And make deals with other
plutocrats fighting for their interests who control
their bloc of legislators &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; The legislature of
the democratic country in question is then just
the playing field of the powerful interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know the rules of the game and, if they
do not play by them, they get slapped down. The
gladiator may not step out of the ring and stab
Caesar. The political system is the arena of the
ruling class, the power elite, the Higher Circles,
the open “conspiracy” of a State. Political
parties and their factions are the tools, the
mock weapons, the counters on the game board for
the rich and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preach populism and soak the rich? Fine,
turn it into the Populist Party and you have, say,
the silver interests sending a rook against a few
pawns of King Republican. Progressivism your bag?
Excellent, the transportation interests can get
“regulation” which will finally solve the troublesome
 problem of cartelization on a relatively free
market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about social democracy? Good, the industries
 of “peace” which were not getting their
“share” of the federal rip-off known as “taxes”
can now expand their markets of goods for the
needy’s “welfare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely Bolshevism, raw State communism, is
immune to plutocratic gain? Ask Pepsi-Cola, which
was just granted a monopoly over Coca-Cola in the
USSR in exchange for a monopoly of sales and distribution
 in Russian wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, if you have just been brought to the
border of acceptance of this awful truth about
Statism, you recoil in horror at the cynical picture
 presented. Is there no hope, you ask? Can
not a Party of Libertarians escape the fate that
has overtaken every other, from Whig to Nazi?
(And if you believe that the National Socialists
were true to &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; campaign promises, ask an old
follower of Ernst Roehm or Gregor Strasser.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. No hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do we have to play the game in which
the other side has made the rules and has all the
pieces? There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another game whose only rules
are the laws of nature, whose rules we can deduce
from the study of science and praxeology. These
rules are not subject to whimsical legislation and
the clash of interests, whatever interpretation
you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market still works on the basis of supply
and demand. And always will. And anyone who can
get goods with relatively low cost (perhaps with
high risks if there is a lot of State intervention)
to one willing and able to pay a relatively high
price will still earn a profit. The worker usefully
 engaged in satisfying demanded production will
earn his wages—if he accepts the risk and takes
needed precautions against rip-offs. The investor
can still gain his interest by backing the aforementioned
 entrepreneur and labourer—if he hedges
against the State-caused inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those whose wealth arose and is maintained
in defiance of the State and is threatened by the
State’s existence will be moved by self-interest
to destroy his enemy—just as the plutocrat is
motivated to maintain the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the arena over the agora if you will.
I intend to pick up my marbles and go home. And
have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hosperscult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1973, Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarchocolumnist (YFNA—ed.) tore into
shreads an article written by John Hospers, Ph. D. The article fuzzed up the archy/anarchy
controversy, and it will probably be viewed historically as the last ditch defense of minarchy
 through obfuscation. As far as I know, Hospers has ceased &amp;amp; desisted in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me keep the fuzz out of one realm: personalities. Go-betweens inform me that Dr.
John was offended by a lowly doctoral candidate in theoretical chemistry blowing his professorial
 dissertation. Of course, &lt;em&gt;scientists&lt;/em&gt; are required to use rigour and logic on a day-to-day
 basis... No, the good doctor need not feel miffed and was assured of no rancor.
Since his Abaco fomenting, he seems to have broadened his outlook and is developing quite
admiringly. As a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critique I wrote was part of a general attack on REASON. The magazine has improved
somewhat since then, printing some tame anarchists; and, as I said, so has Hospers. But a
new phenomenon has arisen, one which evokes guffaws as a response, hardly deserving of the
ponderous artillery of Aristotle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refer to Hosperscult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YFNA has seen many “cults of personality”
 come and go. When he came along
in 1969, Rand was out, Branden was in
decline, Leonard Read was receding, and
LeFevre and Rothbard were shining. Above
all was the intellectual giant, Ludwig
von Mises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were individuals of achievement,
 men and women who stood as examples
of the efficacy of a single person—the
unique one. The heresy of “following” an
individualist is damning enough—but so
easily understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them earned this respect. By
their own efforts. In the all-too-hostile
 marketplace. Nobody “voted” them
awards... until much past their prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then can we think of a movement
which honours those of no visible achievement?
 Surely libertarians, anti-Statists
of all persuasions, cannot regard vote-getting
 as a worthy achievement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for the sake of a column, let’s
suppose that we can admire it as an accomplishment
 of some sort—as we might admire
 the Isolationist aspects of Hitler’s
or Mao’s foreign policy even while recoiling
 in choking fury from their domestic.
 Very well. Now, let’s see, how many
votes &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; Hospers get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No John C. Fremont here. Again, lest
poor Doc John feel put upon, let us throw in
Fran &lt;em&gt;“I Bring Much”&lt;/em&gt; Youngstein, who got one-third
 as many votes as she got petition signatures!
 And let us mercifully forget the
quixotic campaigns of Messrs. Block and Greenberg,
 with their ballotophelic “Outlook.” One
thing we can say about libertarian candidates
in general—they sure don’t threaten us with
their charisma. That is, they are not going
to turn the general public into fanatical arm-banded
 followers for a coup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; charismatic libertarians. Dana
Rohrbacher and Robert LeFevre come quickly to
mind. Is it coincidence that they are anti-“political”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would urge upon my fellow libertarians
an end to attacks on—and thus defense of—the
professor. Let him gracefully slip away after
the coming debacle in California for the LP
there, and get back to his work of self-improvement.
 Perhaps his greatness lies waiting
yet to blossom, and we are distracting and
stunting it by dumping on all this fertilizer
prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the Libertarian Party could move
back in tune with the Movement by offering a
joke candidate. Someone whose only claim to
political accomplishment is the acquisition of
a meaningless office, and who would campaign in
a whimsical, folksy, one-of-the-rednecks
manner. Like an Electoral College graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see it all now: “Don’t Leave
MacBride at the Altar—He’s the Best Man!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to forward to your readers some information I have concerning the
organizations you mention in your TAX RESISTANCE issue of the &lt;em&gt;Southern Libertarian
Messenger,&lt;/em&gt; also known as the February, 1973 issue, alias Vol. I, No. 10. A fine
publication, by the way, worthy of the Libertarian Regional Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Thornton, the current National Office of SLAM, is working at the Laissez
Faire Book Store because he was purged from War Tax Resisters for agorist deviationism.
 I do not believe in that crap about withdrawing sanction from every business
 which happens to be run by immoral people, i.e., those with differing political-ethical
 views, but I would think it appropriate that any libertarians dealing
with WTR indicate in their communications their agorist persuasion and take any
opportunity possible for berating WTR for their left bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all your readers are old Rightists, like us, David. (Maybe I Just speak
for myself?) You should explain to them when mentioning &lt;em&gt;The American Mercury&lt;/em&gt; that
it is the flagship publication of Willis Carto’s Fraudulent Empire of Hate. Carto
is a Yockeyist, the author of the &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Imperium.&lt;/em&gt; However, even the Nazis
 are abandoning him because of the fact that he runs his &lt;em&gt;American Mercury/Washington
 Observer&lt;/em&gt;-etc. as a shill, constantly soliciting funds from the aspiring-intellectual
 bigots for actions and projects which either never take off or are far
below expectations. I was highly amused by that large ad the &lt;em&gt;New Banner&lt;/em&gt; gave the
&lt;em&gt;Mercury.&lt;/em&gt; Those ex-objectivists never did get to know the Right, and they are paying
 for their Rand-imposed ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also might mention that the Student Libertarian Action Movement and the
Free Libertarian Party radical caucus, with hoped-for assists from the New York
Libertarian Association and the Society for Individual Liberty, will be in Libertarian
 Alliance for the Demonstration TAX IS THEFT, April 14 at 10AM, at 120
Church Street, Manhattan (the IRS Centre). Any freedom-symps among your readers
who happen to be around then, and want to get into Libertarian Action, are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to smash the state. You forgot yesterday, and, sure enough,
it’s still here.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for setting-us straight, Sam. Some additional information has come
to light since we went to press last month. The Tax Rebellion Committee (1843
E. Balmont, Fresno, CA 93701) distributes some material on resisting and abolishing
 the income tax, and Henry Hohenstein (Suite 3K, 2530 (Continued on page 6)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read both Higher
 Circles[1] land Conspiracy[2]
 but fail to see
how talking about
“THEM” advances libertarian
 thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—David F. Nolan, postscript
 to last of the
Nolan-Konkin Letters
(NLN 15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year is 1941, and
you are there. You have
sat at the knee of Albert
J. Nock, perhaps along with Frank Chodorov.
 You dig through old bookstores to
find books by Lysander Spooner and
trade copies of Benjamin Tucker’s &lt;em&gt;Liberty&lt;/em&gt;
 with the “Remnant” like yourself.
You speak out, perhaps on a campus,
against “that man in the White House,”
and his eclectic but statist economics.
You are a libertarian activist, perhaps
ahead of your time. And there is a
bloody holocaust in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the people you associate
with on the Right, represented by Eugene
 Lyons’ &lt;em&gt;American Mercury,&lt;/em&gt; are for
going to war against National Socialism
and Fascism, extreme Leftist ideologues
viciously out to uproot and radicalize
anything remotely “conservative.” According
 to the information available at
the time[3] they intend to ravage Europe
like a horde of Huns, with fire and
sword, blood and iron. Next to them,
the Bolsheviks seem safe, tame, and non-interventionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Left is almost universally opposed
 to American participation, at
least until June; then the bellicose,
more-American-than-thou Communists
“Wrap themselves in the American Flag
so you can hardly see the hammer-and-sickle”
 and join the crusade against
their erstwhile ally, and split with
the predominately pacifist Socialists.[4]
The ideologues and purveyors of political
 nostrums scream for “War!”, to save
the Jews, the French, the Russians, Europe,
 Asia. . . the World! And you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with this background,
 you may be ready to go
along. After all, nothing is
more statist than Fascism,
right? Would it not be worth
it to use limited states (such
as the U.S. and Great Britain)
against the totalitarians?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fork in the road towards
 either successful anti-state
 strategy or towards becoming
 dupes of the power
elite creates a choice which
requires additional information
to rationally make. Suppose, unlike many
of your friends and allies, you have been
talking to the Harry Elmer Barneses, the
Charles Beards, and their students—talking
 about THEM: the ruling class, power
elite, superstatists, etc. You know from
Franz Oppenheimer (through Nock) that the
State splits society into two classes:
those that make a net gain by its existence
 (the “exploiters”) and those that
lose (the “exploited”) and leading those
whose wealth is amassed by wholesale theft
and murder, the elite plutocrats who the
Revisionists expose. You know how they
caused World War I, and the financial killings
 (non-market, needless to say) the
Warburgs, Mellons, and Shiffs made. You
look for signs of that around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you look deep enough, they are
there. Speeches of “Liberal” bureaucrats
exhorting support for the newly enacted
draft and the mobilizing War Machine.[6]
Plans in the “in” Journals for heavy economic
 controls, cartelization, and nationalization
 as in World War I—but these
won’t be dismantled this time.[7] You see
Roosevelt meeting with Churchill, promising
 him all support “short of war,”
and then see his actions: U.S. Navy ships
firing on Axis submarines, U.S. “gift” of
50 destroyers to the U.K., U.S. invasion
of Iceland, U.S. support to China in the
Far East, U.S. embargo of Japan, U.S.
seizure of all Japanese assets in the U.S.,
U.S. refusal to negotiate with an almost
begging Japan unless Japan denounces all
her allies,
abandons all territories outside its own islands, and completely reverses her foreign
 policy to subservience under the U.S.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an ounce of morality in you, you Join America First! You campaign
against Roosevelt’s actions, and expose him at [FIXME: missed text?] every turn. You
burn your fellow libertarians’ ears with your Revisionism so they won’t support
the domestic power grab, and tell everyone to fight the fascism at home, leaving
Europe to fight its own. You may fail when the Japanese are driven to bomb
Pearl Harbor to get “them” before “they” get the Japanese, causing the American
populace to drop their isolationism and follow Roosevelt. And the Germans fall
into the trap by almost insanely living up to their Pact with Japan, even though
their hands are full in Africa and Russia. But thirty years later, a new, resurgent
 libertarian movement arises out of the Right and Left where your allies
had become dupes, denouncing them for their folly, and looking back for trades of
your heroic opposition for their new inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the “Peace” movement rolls over, fetches, and does-simple tricks for
Richard Nixon when it comes to his foreign policy. An era of detente, thawing of
the Cold War, peace everywhere, myths shattering, and the Wall Street Barons realizing
 the limitations of U.S. “world policeman” role. What shivers of ecstacy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a pile ordure to any Revisionist with his nose open! China, manipulated
 into a paranoia of Russians, reversing policy to desiring U.S. presence in
Asia as a “counter-balance”! The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, finally
paying the price of following Marxist zero-think on agricultural economics and
starving, goes hat in hand to the U.S., begging for food. The terms are $24 million
 a year, to pay a debt (until 2001) neither the Russian slaves nor even their
present masters incurred thirty years before, to repay not the individuals residing
 in North America who had originally been ripped-off for 100-times as much,
but those who follow in the footsteps of the thieves. In short, every Russian is
paying a dime a year tribute to the Empire of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepsi-Cola is granted a monopoly by the Soviet statist to sell cola, in exchange
 for the Monsieur Henri wines branch of Pepsi selling Russian booze in the
U.S. Monopolies coming and going as the U.S. power elite shows their junior
partners in Moscow how to rake it off. Favors are thrown to the agri-plutocrats
in the form of a grain deal windfall along with cut-rate prices to the properly
humbled Soviet satraps—at U.S. taxpayer expense. Imperium reigns and Pax Americana
 rules the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumor has it David Rockefeller wants his grandchildren named Julius and
Augustus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;By Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Richard Nixon bored everyone with his landslide on November 7,
Canadians were treated to a cliff-hanger a week earlier on October 30.
The pollsters confidently predicted a Trudeau return as Maritime
provinces’ results swung slightly towards the Liberal Party, and Quebec
cut the Progressive Conservative seats from four to two (out of 74). True,
the Social Credit Rally (Ralliement Creditiste) increased their popular
vote substantially, but gained only one seat. Then Ontario came in with
the social democratic New Democrat Party and the Progressive Conservatives
 slashing into the Grit (Liberal) standings. And then the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alberta, all four Liberal seats were buried under a Tory (PC)
avalanche. British Columbia moved the Tories even with the Grits, and
brought in the NDP main strength. The Northwest Territories gave the
NDP their first “frontier” seat (Grit loss) and the Tories held on to the
Yukon to put them one seat up, 109-108.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada does not allow absentee balloting, except for one special case.
The Social Credit Party’s sole gain was at the expense of Jean-Luc Pepin,
a Liberal Cabinet Minister involved in what Murray Rothbard called
Quebec’s “White Terror” suspension of civil rights of a few years ago,
and, since the Creditistes are the federal party which most free market
libertarians (especially minarchists) in the U.S. would sympathize with,
it seemed like divine justice. Unfortunately, the military votes Grit, and
their absentee ballots reversed the 100-vote margin, knocking the
Creditistes back to 14 seats. Libertarians can probably read symbolism
into that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final standings of 109 seats each for the Liberals and P. C.’s, 30 for
the NDP, 14 for SC, one Independent Conservative and one Independent
(speaker of the House Lucien Lamoureux—non-partisan) tell the
average American nothing, assuming he even heard of them. For the
libertarians wanting of know who to cheer and who to boo—as Dr.
Rothbard is wont—even less. I shall undertake here to give you a
programme to go with your scorecard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Social Credit Party used to be based in the rightist West, Alberta
and British Columbia, and was a free market, pro-American party with a
funny money policy they could not legislate because they had only controlled
 provincial governments. They never had more than a minority in
the national House of Commons. In 1963, they defeated John Diefen-baker’s
 minority Tory government because he failed to balance the
budget. In 1962, Real Caouette led his Quebecers into the House in larger
numbers than the Western wing, and the party eventually split. The
Western wing withdrew in favor of P. C.’s to stem the Trudeau sweep of
1968, and never recovered. Caouette kept his more orthodix Social Credit
position, appealing populistically to the Quebec habitants (peasant
farmers) and stayed in the House. Recently he tried to expand westward,
but failed to restore the party outside Quebec (although there are still a
few Socred diehards lurking in rightist circles in ranch and oil country).
The Alberta provincial Socreds were thrown out of office for the first
time in 35 years in 1970 by Kennedyesque Tory Peter Lougheed, and their
very survival as a party depends on Lougheed’s self-destruction. This 
year in British Columbia, W. A. C. Bennett’s 20-year Socred regime was
ousted by the NDP in an even greater victory, marking a swing from far
Right to far Left in the Canadian four-party spectrum. Although Caouette
increased his popular vote markedly, and signs of organization were seen
again throughout Canada, the recent net effect for the “good guys” (least
worst guys) is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Leftist bad guys, the New Democrat Party, which is labour backed
and oriented, like the British Labour Party, now has three provincial
governments (B. C, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) and their largest
number of seats ever in the Federal House. American investors are fleeing
 B. C. right now, and Canadian capitalists are screaming to the federal
government to bail them out by preventing nationalization of federal
regulated industries. &lt;em&gt;Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big gains federally were reaped by Robert Stanfield’s Progressive
Conservative Party, but it cannot take over the government without 25
more seats—and the Creditistes haven’t got that many. The Tories are
conservative, but in the British/European sense, not (except for a small
Ontario faction) in the American quasi-libertarian sense. Hence they love
mercantilism and fear gradual socialism much less. Thus NDP support
for the right Welfarist concessions is thinkable, and the NDP’s and PC’s
both are anti-American (just as the Liberals and SC’s are pro-American).
Their foreign policy might seem more appealing to a libertarian; but it
manifests itself in increasing government regulation of corporations
(50% of Canadian companies are American controlled) and in little which
could be considered objective anti-imperialism. The NDP leader, David
Lewis, will “throw his support behind whichever of the old line parties is
prepared to deal adequately with unemployment, inflation, old age pensions,
 and a more equitable tax system.”[1] Coming from a socialist, that seems
ominous. I doubt that libertarians could imagine a worse nightmare
 than a de facto socialist-traditionalist coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudeaumania is gone, but Pierre Elliot Trudeau clings on. He has not
resigned, and it looks as if he will try to keep governing, daring the Opposition
 to precipitate an election by defeating him on a non-confidence
motion. Here, precedent is murky. There is no reason the figurehead
Governor-General can’t ask the Tories to try to gain confidence for a
majority—but in 1926, Governor General Lord Byng refused Liberal
Mackenzie King’s request for dissolution of Parliament, and invited
Conservative Arthur Meighen to govern. His bungling Progressive supporters
 blew a “pairing”, bringing him down only days later, and William
Lyon Mackenzie King rode to victory attacking Byng’s interference.
Would Roland Michener have the guts of Lord Byng? Ultimately, the
Tories may be thwarted by this vestige of royal privilege. Michener was a
Conservative, to add to the irony, but was appointed by a Liberal government,
 following a recent cross-party tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Trudeau has a problem if Michener doesn’t give him an issue. The
electorate might decide to finish the job by giving Stanfield a majority.
Diefenbaker ended 22 years of Liberal government in 1957, and dissolved
his minority government early in 1958 calling for just such a majority. He
won a record 208 out of 265 seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Lester Bowles Pearson won two minority
governments in a row of 1963 and 1965 after a Tory minority of 1962, failing
 to get the majority he craved. He limped along in the Centre, depending
 on Social Credit support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in the Grits’ interest to give the Tories the government, so that
Stanfield can begin to alienate voters. But it’s not in Trudeau’s interest,
as shown by Diefenbaker’s ouster after his election defeat by a particularly
 brutal purge which caused enough resentment in the West to
give Trudeau his 1968 victory in the first place. Trudeau’s ouster would
not be so regionally oriented, because half of the Liberal seats are in
Quebec anyway, and his followers have nowhere to go but the Creditistes,
the Tories being unthinkable and the NDP frowned on by the Catholic
Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French-English split is being played up by foreign papers, and the
Separatists may be bolstered by the defeat of their centralist enemy
Trudeau—but that is a Provincial effect, not a Federal one. Furthermore,
 resentment against compulsory bilingualism/biculturalism is
found in the third of the population of non-WASP origin (mostly in the
West) such as German, Ukrainian, Galician, Icelander, Dutch, Russian,
and others who are just speaking English in the first or second generation.
 The only real amelioration will be found in reviving the Social Credit
and Union Nationale’s (a Quebec provincial party, recently defeated by
the Grits) demand for greater decentralism and provincial rights. The
present trend is the other way, but Canadians are a remarkably non-revolutionary
 lot, pointing with pride to their “evolution” from Great
Britain, as opposed to the Americans’ messy violence. Quebec independence
 will be gained gradually if at all, by the Parti Quebec
parliamentarily (with both RIN-socialistic-and RN-Creditiste-wings) and
not by the ten to fifteen FLQ[2] goons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revolution in Canada is a bigger joke than in the U.S., and rather than
radical change, resulting from elimination of Trudeau’s flashy, slightly-leftist
 liberalism (he flirted with price controls but never implemented
them, by the way) one should expect stodginess, anti-communist witch-hunts
 from Liberal renegade Paul Hellyer, and the ominous economic
changes resulting from NDP support. Canadian libertarians and their
American allies should be hoping for a new election and a minority
government with Creditiste swing vote power. Failing that, how about
Parliamentary Chaos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Before becoming a well-known libertarian activist and writer, Mr. Konkin was a Socred activist, and Chairman of the University of Alberta Social Credit Party from 1966-68. He became senior participant in the Model Parliaments, and was involved in all Canadian and Alberta elections from 1962 to 1968. He is now a foreign student at New York University, a candidate for a Ph. D. in Theoretical Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Editor’s note: The Libertarian Party had no perceptible effect on the election,
 but its achievement is nonetheless remarkable. Starting from scratch the LP
in a few months grew into one of the movement’s largest organizations, galvanizing
hundreds on the indifferent fringe of libertarianism into activism and attracting
nationwide press coverage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(However, the LP has its problems, not the least of which is criticism from
fellow libertarians. In the interest of examining this criticism the&lt;/em&gt; Southern
Libertarian Messenger &lt;em&gt;presents the two letters below. The first is that of Mr.
David Nolan, a founder of the Party and presently its National Chairman, writing
in response to an editorial in the August, 1972&lt;/em&gt; New Libertarian Notes. &lt;em&gt;The second
letter is by Mr. Samuel Edward Konkin III, editor of&lt;/em&gt; NLN, &lt;em&gt;and a leader in the Student
 Libertarian Action Movement and the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The letters form the first part of an exchange of several letters. For one
dollar Xerox copies of the complete correspondence may be obtained from Mr. Konkin
at 635 East 11th Street, Apt. 24, New York, NY 10009.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Open Letter to SLAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the founders of the Libertarian Party, I found your August issue of
&lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt; very interesting, and would like to offer some reactions to
some of the comments therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I found your comments on our approach towards achieving Freedom In Our
Time Surprisingly fair, considering the basic differences between your views and
ours. And, while we certainly don’t expect you to agree with everything we’re doing,
 we hope that you will continue to remain “friendly” adversaries, rather than
becoming openly hostile to our efforts, as the LeFevre people have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences between LP and SLAM exist, as I see it, on two levels. The
more basic difference, of course, is that you are anarchists, while we are not, at
least for the most part. About 15% to 25% of our members are anarchists, but the
Party as an organization has taken stands that are explicitly anti-anarchist, and
we have no intention of changing our position. (We, too, have our principles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary difference is one of disagreement over tactics. You tend to
favor a radical, or even revolutionary, approach, while we favor a more moderate,
gradualist approach. Only time will tell which approach is better, and, indeed,
it may be that both have their place. You say that our approach may turn off “revolutionaries”
 and “libertarians evolving from the Left.” And quite possibly this
is so. We counter this point, however, by stating that &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; approach will turn
off &lt;em&gt;everyone else. . .&lt;/em&gt; and we think more can be gained, in terms of rolling back
the State, by convincing 51% of the American people to dismantle the State by 49%
than by convincing 1% of the people to dismantle it by 99%.
We don’t ask you to buy this line of reasoning, but point it out simply to show
that there is a consistent rationale behind our methodology, just as there is, no
doubt, behind yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say, correctly, that anyone who advocates &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; (or even maintaining)
the current level of State Power is an enemy of freedom. I agree. And the LP certainly
 does not advocate any such thing. We differ from you only in how far, how
fast, and by what means we advocate cutting the State down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 1972 Platform calls nowhere for increasing State Power: in some areas
(such as defense) it simply advocates a change in priorities, but even there, the
net effect would be one of less government action, not more. (Considering our defense
 plank specifically, it should be noted that we call for a strengthened defense
 system for the &lt;em&gt;U.S. only,&lt;/em&gt; while simultaneously calling for a drastic cutback—even
 a virtual elimination—of our commitment to defend other nations. Thus,
while it is true—as &lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt; said—that a beefed-up defense system of a
“world policeman” nature would require more spending, the arrangement we advocate
would not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most areas, our Platform calls for outright repeal or abolition of government
 activities. In others, merely a substantial reduction. And on balance, it
is—I think you will agree—quite a bit more explicit and “radical” than its predecessor,
 the Temporary Platform. Furthermore, I might point out that if it is not
as “radical” as you might wish, then this is because those who are carping and
bitching the most did not choose to attend the convention at which it was drafted.
We even went so far as to ask the &lt;em&gt;New Banner&lt;/em&gt; to publish a notice urging anarcho-capitalists
 to attend and make their presence felt, but they declined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You charge that we will become increasingly statist and compromise-prone as
we grow larger, and that we will put “pressure” on other libertarian organizations
to “serve our interests.” The former allegation is sheer speculation; all evidence
 to date runs counter to it, in fact. As for the latter—just how would we
exert this “pressure,” even if we wanted to? We have no power over any other
group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting is the fact that despite your expressed worries on this
point, you do not seem to be against the idea of one libertarian group “pressuring”
another &lt;em&gt;per se,&lt;/em&gt; as you say that SLAM’s “first task” at the moment is “the organization
 of an LP Radical Caucus.” Who is trying to pressure whom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in any event, we have no objection to your forming such a Caucus. We
welcome all libertarians into our ranks, and I personally feel that the presence
of a Radical Caucus would be healthy for the Party, if for no other reason than
that it would serve as a counter-pressure to the influence of semi-libertarians
who will no doubt be coming into the Party in increasing numbers, as the GOP and
Democrats become increasingly repulsive. I only hope that when the Radical Caucus
doesn’t always get its own way, it won’t turn around and try to wreck the Party,
thus paying into the hands of the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; enemy—the Nixons and Humphreys of the
world. Fighting our friends—even marginal friends—makes no sense, when there
are so many common foes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, good luck, and keep the lines of communication open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
David F . Nolan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Nolan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased you find us fair, and hope we shall be found so always. I am
amused of your description of the LeFevre People as “openly hostile,” since they
are well-known pacifists. I do not believe we are secretly hostile, and we are
certainly openly criticized. The two levels you discern are both accurate, and I
am glad to have your admission (openly) that the Party is “explicitly anti-anarchist,
 and we have no intention of changing our position.” I have been trying to
convince several people of that here in New York, and I hope they are willing to
take your word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, our position, as you state, will turn off everyone else, initially.
We would have liked to have an all-encompassing libertarian alliance to attract
everyone to us for any reason, and have him enter the faction of his taste. As
my editorials point out, your presence has made that option no longer possible,
and, I have analysed, an organization was needed to attract those you must perforce
 leave out. Thus was SLAM resurrected. I hope neither of us will be found
guilty of believing that anyone’s politics are immutable, and that, in fact, our
aims are to both of us to convert (i.e. &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;) the positions of the people of
the world to some form of libertarianism, if only in its most fundamental form—leave
 me alone! I find yourself damning by your statistics, in that you wish to
only roll the state back by 49%. When I was a fellow National Office (“trad”)
delegate with you to the 1969 National YAF Convention, I wished to see the elimination
 of 99% of the State’s activities (all but defense and police), and, I am
shocked to see that as I have progressed to advocating the elimination of the
rest, you have actually slid back. As anarchists, we wish to convince as many
people as it takes to eliminate 100% of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, let us proceed to your Defense plank. &lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt;’s argument
was NOT for a “world policeman” nature of defense system in its advocacy of a
beefed-up defense spending, but for the nuclear protection of the continental
United States. You might wish to argue that eliminating the imperialist role of
the U.S. will unleash funds, a fraction of which you would then use for continental
arms increase. I personally do not wish to get embroiled in this kind of argument,
analogous to McGovern welfare economics, but simply submit that, in the given area
for defense of the arbitrarily bounded geographical area called the United States
of America, you would &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; State spending over the level it now occupies. If
not, your angry “semi-libertarian” members may wish to ask you just where you disagree
 with &lt;em&gt;NR&lt;/em&gt;’s defense experts, and I shall leave you to their tender mercies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think your taking some of your Temporary Platform positions and making
 them wishy-washy or deliberately ambiguous in the new Platform constitutes radicalizing
 it. As to your implied attack on my “talk, not do,” I suggest you check
your records to find that I was listed as a delegate to your National Convention as
a “representative” for New York. I was unable to travel because of lack of financial
 resources. I am not crying on anyone’s shoulder about it, but I do think
your “carping and bitching” at me is unwarranted. I am delighted to think that you
voted dissolution of the Convention, and reconvened as SLAM, or even LA. While
Colorado is inaccessible to all but rich, hardy, or Coloradan, the State conventions
 coming up should provide the check your hypothesis concerning
 our effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have already grown more statist by your selecting of John Hospers as your
presidential candidate. According to my source at his Press Conference, Dana Rohrabacher,
 he claimed he was 95% in agreement with conservatives, and when asked by
Dana how he could reconcile his defence and economic positions, Hospers stated that
the economic ones were just theoretical and that he did not expect them to be enacted.
 No longer “sheer speculation,” now stark fact! As to the “pressure” question,
 you should, I suggest, re-read that in context of the Editorial. Clearly,
 I was describing the pressure exerted by your existence, and seeming “success.”
The pressure on activists to defend you when something called “libertarian” is attacked
 in their own circles. The pressure to join one’s nearest ideological neighbors,
 and, if they are in a Party, to participate in these pro-Party activities
they will engage in. And for groups, which will be constantly identified with the
Libertarian Party if the identify themselves as “libertarian,” to either defend
it, or attack it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LP Radical Caucus’s “pressuring” of the Party hierarchy and bureaucracy we
seriously do not expect: the use of us as a counterweight against the Birchers, Objectivists,
 and conservatives in your midst, I do expect. The fundamental task of
LPRC is to reach those people whom, as you earlier pointed out, will not be reached
by SLAM and who can no longer be reached by the defunct LA. In short, we are trying
 to turn on “everyone” who is susceptible to radical libertarianism, however
reaching more. If you wish to set up a “Statist Caucus” in SLAM, feel free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Party will eventually be wrecked, not because we will come in there with
swinging maces, or the archetypical bombs, or even because of our “explosive” rhetoric.
 Not, unhappily, because the State is abolished and it will self-destruct
out of uselessness. No, Mr. Nolan, as I said earlier in passing, we both attend
the St. Louis Convention in 1969. You remained loyal to National Office, while
I, repelled by the injustice and purgings initiated by that group, went over to the
Libertarian Caucus, even though it involved breaking a personal commitment to my
friend, David Keene. You know what state the Young Americans for Freedom is in today.
 So shall be the fate of the Libertarian Party when it begins sacking state
committees and challenging credentials at some convention in the near future to
stop a potential majority of radical libertarians from crystallizing. And there
will be young delegates, like us three years ago, who will be driven to choose, and
in choosing, come to realize the necessary consequences of the opposing philosophies,
 the “ideas that have consequences.” Out of the debacle will arise a new
vigorous anarchist movement in numbers enough to proceed on the Final Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can abort this scenario at any point by beginning the purge early. Pass a
prohibition against membership by anarchists, throw those of us who are on State
Committees or other “positions of influence” out before we have a chance to spread.
You can find me in the Executive Committee of the Free Libertarian Party of New
York, awaiting your ax, and you would do me the favour of fulfilling: the prediction
I made to my skeptical colleagues. Of course, you realize what an issue you would
give us. Especially when we evil, horned creatures and “carping, bitching” malcontents
 turn out to be rational and armed with facts and answers to the curious questions
 of the innocent you may have taken into the Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting our friends never makes sense, nor even fighting neutrals. Fighting
those within our midst who will deliver us unto our enemies always makes sense. I
am sure you feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, David, and I certainly shall keep the lines open. As my friends
know, I would sit down with the devil for a drink and a political argument. Maybe
even Richard Nixon. Definitely David Nolan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours in Freedom,&lt;br /&gt;

Part II Post-1969&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer of 1969 will be remembered as the sprouting of the modern libertarian
movement. The Objectivists were in turmoil over Branden’s ouster, and many were being
 picked up by Wollstein’s anarcho-objectivist Society for Rational Individualism
(SRI). The seeds of libertarian caucus organization in YAF after the 1967 convention
came to flower in the libertarian takeover of Pennsylvania and California state YAF’s
with Rothbard’s influence putting a few anarchists into the New York State group, and
Karl Hess’s son in Virginia another small group. Many of these Rothbardians, organizing
 into the Radical Libertarian Alliance, attended the SDS National Convention.
Anarchists were being purged before the convention even began, and the group which
had been organized by decentralists, community control advocates and anarchists, ended
 up with nought but the Revolutionary Youth Movement and the Progressive Labor Party,
 not to mention a few Independent Socialists. The first order of business was the
purge of the IS, then the PL. Unfortunately, PL had stacked the Convention too well,
and RYM found itself out-voted. Like good democrats, they rejected the majority decision
 and ran off to grab the National Office files. Each group called itself the
one and only SDS. SDS-RYM promptly split again into RYM-I (Weatherman) and RYM-II
(Bay Area Revolutionary Union, mostly). The RLA and their new friends, the Student
Libertarian Action Movement, went home, with three SDS chapters (including Lysander
Spooner SDS) to add to their disillusioned YAF chapters into RLA. Now, they thought,
for the YAF convention, let us try to organize an Anarchist Caucus. And they did,
writing aboard Karl Hess’s yacht, the &lt;em&gt;Tranquil,&lt;/em&gt; the Tranquil Statement, for enlightenment
 of the YAF average delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But purges were underway in YAF. First, Wallacism had to go, especially as it
was being succeeded by Willis Carto’s real racism, and Yockeyite neo-nazism. Some
libertarians who supported this action became uneasy when Objectivist chapters were
purged next. Then came the dismissal of the Pennsylvania and California State Offices.
 Needless to say, the libertarians rose up angrily, and Libertarian Caucus mailings
 began to appear across the country with appeals for delegates to overturn the
rulings. In Wisconsin, where David Keene awaited his inevitable succession to the
National Chairmanship (with, I might add, LC endorsement!), the author of this paper
sat blissfully unaware of anything but rumors of malcontents and subversives, and accepted
 a delegate status (as the token Canadian?) with the understanding that Keene
was to be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at St. Louis, Labor Day, 1969, your author was as interested in the St.
Louis World Science Fiction Convention as much as the national YAF convention. But
the meeting with Dana Rohrabacher of California and Don Ernsberger of Pennsylvania,
the ousted LC leaders, instructed one as to the perfidies of the National Office.
The Wisconsin delegation broke, and I and my roommate found our vote for the key Executive
 Committee positions wrested from us through parliamentarianism. We were more
“in” with the establishment than were many of the 100 LCers who lost their credentials
 battles, and regained our votes for the Issues, but by then the votes were_running
 700 to 200 against us. Michael Ingallinera of Virginia, who ran as a “Philosophical
 Anarchist“ received 50, which was the maximum strength of the Anarchist Caucus,
 Rohrabacher got around 250 which was the maximum non-purged LC strength. Then
one of the AC lit a Xerox copy of his draft card before a television camera. The
Traditionalists tried to annihilate him physically, and he was protected by a living
shield of libertarians. Radicalization had set in, and the RLA-SLAM people had found
their mission: &lt;em&gt;agents provacateurs.&lt;/em&gt; Many of us went home, convinced by Keene that
justice would triumph and the splits would be healed. Come 1971, why, we would &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
 be organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trads retained control of both California and Pennsylvania, and Ernsberger’s
group joined Wollstein’s SRI to form the Society for Individual Liberty (SIL). The
Rohrabacher wing formed the California Libertarian Alliance,
and Dana travelled around the country, seeding local LA’s with ex-YAFers. Your author
 foundedh the University of Wisconsin LA in late 1969, and the Wisconsin LA the
following summer. Meanwhile, many of us went to New York for the first Libertarian
Conference, held Columbus Day, and featuring Rothbard and Hess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strange things had happened to the Trad speechwriter for Barry Goldwater
who had gone Objectivist, then joined the Constitutional Alliance of Oakley Bramble,
and finally rediscovered the Taftites camped out in New York. Murray Rothbard had
tried to carry the Word in &lt;em&gt;Left and Right,&lt;/em&gt; but finally gave that up for the &lt;em&gt;Libertarian
 Forum&lt;/em&gt; (nee &lt;em&gt;Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;) and Hess became the Washington editor. Hess wrote an
article for &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;, “The Death of Politics,” which came to be one of the major recruiting
 tools of the movement. But almost as it was printed, his fascination with
the Leftists that Murray had formed tactical alliances with led him to repudiate
most of it, and attempt to work with the Black Panthers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-SDSers and YAFers met each other at the conference and promptly split
into a group which followed Hess into an attack on Fort Dix, and a group which
stayed around to hear Murray discuss economics and Revisionist History. Some of us
were a bit skeptical of our viability at the time, but nevertheless, this author, at
least, became an anarchist at that time. In February, 1970 Dana staged a California
libertarian conference, again “Left-Right,“ which had 500 people and amazing harmony
between anarcho-capitalists and anarcho-communists. Fired up at this success, we
returned to our homes to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, this author moved to New York—interestingly enough, so did
the action. The RLA, rent by the Hessian defections to the Far Left, began to whither,
 and their &lt;em&gt;Abolitionist&lt;/em&gt; watered itself down until it became the modern wishy-washy
&lt;em&gt;Outlook.&lt;/em&gt; SIL’s &lt;em&gt;Individualist&lt;/em&gt; schedule became more erratic, although their &lt;em&gt;SIL
News,&lt;/em&gt; handled directly by Ernsberger, remained regular. CLA’s venture into slick
publishing, financed by Robert LeFevre’s Rampart College, went two issues as &lt;em&gt;Pine
Tree,&lt;/em&gt; two more as &lt;em&gt;Rap,&lt;/em&gt; and folded. LeFevre, a pacifist “autarhist” began to lose
contributors from his more conservative older followers worried about this influx of,
and support for, long-hairs and weirdos. Rohrabacher has recently returned to activism
 in California and the sagging movement is coming alive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down in Arizona, the Student Libertarian Action Movement was embattled by
street fighting with the State, followed by court cases (which SLAM won). That was
immediately followed by a Split into SLAM and the North American Libertarian Alliance,
 which coughed up two issues of &lt;em&gt;Sunburst,&lt;/em&gt; folded, and was resurrected as a Social
 Revolutionary Anarchist Federation local (SRAF is the Left anarchist grouping).
SLAM devolved to just putting out the &lt;em&gt;Match!,&lt;/em&gt; which Fred Woodworth continues to do.
Meanwhile, in New York, as SIL and RLA waned, Gary Greenberg’s New York Libertarian
Association was joined by this author’s New York Libertarian Alliance, and LA’s were
formed on all Manhattan campuses by early 1972, and several others outside of Manhattan.
 &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Notes,&lt;/em&gt; originally a pronunciation pun on &lt;em&gt;NYU Libertarian
Notes,&lt;/em&gt; expanded to cover the East Coast movement. Then came the Libertarian Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of the defeat of the old Preform-Inform crowd’s attempt to
build a new country in the North Sea (which was carved up by Britain, Norway and
Denmark) and their subsequent retreat to nomadism and troglodytism (&lt;em&gt;Vonulife&lt;/em&gt;), no
bigger setback hit the libertarian movement in a decade. The Libertarian Alliance’s
attempt to bring together all libertarians, limited archist or anarchist, left or
right, pro-political party and voting or revolutionary, voter-boycotting, or whatever,
 collapsed. Defections to the Party with the realization that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; positions
 would be identified in the popular mind as what libertarianism was, regardless
of how conservative and statist it was, forced us into an anti-party tactic. First,
an anti-party group was needed to attract people turned off by the Party.
Thus was SLAM reborn in New York. Secondly, a method of reaching the semi-converted
attached to the Party, and exposing them to real libertarianism was needed. At the
moment, organization has begun on a Libertarian Party Radical Caucus. In New York,
the State group has already worked to co-opt us, this
author finding himself on the State Committee/Executive Committee of the Free Libertarian
 Party. LPRC is obviously pictured as analogous to the YAF LC, and it will
be interesting to see if the LP goes in for purges, etc. or some more sophisticated
sell-out and suppression approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you find yourself now. And, as you can deduce, this is where &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;
came in!&lt;/p&gt;

Part I Pre-1969&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, man was free. Then he ran into his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free philosophies have attempted to form throughout history, usually containing
just enough contradictions or errors to have them refuted and discarded like the statist
 theories they were to replace. Then we came along. The first we goes back to
William Godwin, the first anarchist, in the late 1700’s and traces through Josiah
Warren to Lysander Spooner. The limited government freaks can probably trace their
lineage to Jeremy Bentham’s Philosophical Radical Party in England (yes, dear reader,
the first “radicals” were limited archists), which, thanks to its utilitarian base
and John Stuart Mill, drifted toward Fabian democratic socialism. Meanwhile, back in
the U.S.A., Spooner was firming up a pro-property base for anarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is both fascinating to realize (as you will if you read even as little of
Spooner as No Treason) that if Praxeology had been added to Spooner’s position,
amending some of his views on economics, he would have reached the stage of development
 of the present Libertarian Movement, give or take a few deviationists, and dischartening
 to realize that a century has been wasted. This, gentle anarcho-objectivist,
 was all before Ayn Rand was a gleam in her father’s eye. Spooner was an active
abolitionist, shocking his comrades by supporting Southern secession, and demanding
that position as the only one consistent with slave secession from masters. His &lt;em&gt;No
Treason: The Constitution of No Authority&lt;/em&gt; was published around 1870. He, along with
others, passed along the anarchist tradition to Benjamin Tucker, who was the first in
his line to call himself an anarchist from the Word Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker also threatened to be the end of the line. His magazine Liberty was recognized
 as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; radical journal until its demise in 1908. George Bernard Shaw acknowledges
 his debt to Tucker for making him famous, and was briefly an anarchist
himself through Tucker’s influence before continuing his meanderings on the political
spectrum through fascism and socialism. Tucker also laid into the anarcho-communists
of his time, setting westerners straight about Bakunin, Kropotkin, and their ilk.
Supposedly, when Tucker met Kropotkin, those attending expected sparks to fly; actually
 they merely exchanged salutations. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the onslaught of World War I and the seduction of his radical friends into
what he scourged as “State Socialism,” Tucker despaired of the world and went to
France, dying in obscurity just prior to the Second World war. Some of those he had
influenced were followers of the school of Henry George economics, the “Single Taxers.”
 They believed (and still do) that Rent was immorally obtained, and that Land
should not be owned privately (although anything else could). Some of them believed
that government should at most collect this Rent and distribute it to the populace in
the form of services; a few believed that
this “social function” did not even require
 the state. Such a person was Albert
 J. Nook. Those in his Philosophical
camp around the turn of the century were
called Liberals (so was Herbert Spencer,
whom they were also familiar with), but
became Radicals with World War I and the
split caused by Wilson’s “betrayal” by
entering into war and foreign entanglements.
 Eventually, with the post-war
disillusionment, these Revisionists found
their war interpretation to become widely
 accepted, and during the twenties,
Nock, H. L. Mencken, and others were well-known
 and popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Depression
and World war II
caused another estrangement
 of these neo-Georgist quasi-anarchists
 with the Liberals; first, because
they opposed Statist
solutions of the Hoover
 and later Roosevelt variety to the
economic problems of
the day, and second,
because they were opposed
 to Roosevelt’s
imperialism against
the Axis and the provocation
 of Japan into a totally avoidable
 war. These positions
 brought them into tactical alliance
 with the Old Right, an uneasy alliance.
 Their influence pervades—the Modern
 Right, as indicated by William Buckley’s
 inclusion of two Nock essays in
his definitive book on conservatism
called, &lt;em&gt;Did You Ever See a Dream walking?.&lt;/em&gt;
 One of Nock’s essays was blatantly
 called “Anarchist’s Progress.” During
 this time, young Georgist Frank
Chodorov was brought into an anti-statist
 position by Nock’s influence, and
became one of the Right’s main activists,
founding the Intercollegiate Society of
Individualists and taking Over Mencken’s
American Mercury along with Buckley and
crowd. About this time, a Young Taft
Republican Columbia student named Murray
Rothbard read von Mises and became an economist,
 studying under the master himself.
The Taft wing or “Old Right” continued
their anti-imperialism through the Korean
war, while the liberals and social democrats
 insisted that Americans had a Duty
to save the world from Bolshevism. In
1953, Robert A. Taft died, unleashing a
Wisconsin Populist named Joseph McCarthy.
Chodorov’s remarks on McCarthyism indicate
the beginning of the end for the alliance:
“The way to get rid of Communists in government
 jobs is to get rid of the government
 jobs.” Unfortunately, William Buckley
 and his converted brother-in-law decided
 that Roman Catholicism was insufficiently
 motivating and
declared a Holy Crusade
against International
Communism. They began
by defending McCarthy
in print, and then, as
&lt;em&gt;American Mercury&lt;/em&gt; fell
into the hands of racists,
 founded &lt;em&gt;National
Review&lt;/em&gt; in 1955 and
staffed it with bitter
ex-Communists. Rothbard, who had made
 friends with many of
these people at the
time, such as &lt;em&gt;NR&lt;/em&gt;’s ideologue, Frank Meyer,
 split with them in 1957
over irreconcilable foreign policy differences, as he Joined SANE
 and various Left peace
(for him, Isolationist)
groups, and the spectrum
flip-flopped. Around
this time the Objectivist philosophy was
turning into the personality cult of Ayn
Rand and Murray was invited to the formative
 get-togethers. Unfortunately, in 1950
he had already decided that the only consistent
 libertarian position was anarchy,
so he knew his days were numbered. Still,
he had some influence on the early Nathaniel
 Branden Institute students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1960, the New Right got behind Barry
 Goldwater, who symbolized their new synthesis
 of pseudo-free enterprise at home and
American Imperialism abroad. The Youth for
Goldwater became, the following year, a
more ideological youth movement, meeting at
Buckley’s Sharon, Connecticut estate to form
a group of young conservatives. The National Chairman was Bob Schuchman (known to
Rothbard, incidentally) who demanded that the name be the Young Americans for Freedom.
Schuchman was the first and only libertarian Chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldwater campaign of 1964 brought vast recruits to YAF, and the subsequent
battles with the rising New Left, for which YAF was the only organized opposition,
sustained it in between the election years. Even objectivists began to join it,
though prohibited officially from it by Ayn Rand’s dictates. In 1967, a libertarian
caucus was formed from free market, ISI, and FEE style conservatives, semi-objectivists,
 and a few Rothbardians and even Georgists. They promised to really get it
together in 1969, the next biennial National Convention of YAF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Richard Nixon was elected President, fulfilling every conservative’s
dream, and disillusioning every libertarian from his work with the Right, and Murray
Rothbard was into the Peace and Freedom Party, with many of his youthful converts moving
 past him into the SDS, where founders like Carl Oglesby were battling for Anarchy
against the Statist Maoists and Trotskyites who sought control of the group at any
expense. Jarret Wollstein split the Objectivist camp by coming out for anarcho-objectivism
 and the Society for Rational Individualism. And Nathaniel Branden fell from
grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--FIXME: place photo here? or wait till better-quality scan is available?--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we came, we saw, we converted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasantly surprised by the 75 degree weather we encountered
arriving at Denver’s airport, far higher than predicted, we
continue by a long bus ride to Estes Park, Colorado. After the
first night, we awoke to heavy snowfall and deficient plumbing.
Nature was foreshadowing an allegory of the White House
Conference on Youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From April 18 to April 22, budding young
establishmentarians, reform-tripping on parliamentary procedure,
and a few free-loading radicals condensed from around the world
to Estes Park, the new mecca for Meeting Freaks.
Several invitations to the Conference were passed along the
spectrum from conservative to less conservative libertarians; most
invitations were ultimately turned down. Final judgement as to
who should receive the applications for invitations ended in the
hands of Society for Individual Liberty / California Libertarian
Alliance axis leadership, and led to complaints by Eastern RLA of
exclusion. Nevertheless, all three libertarians who swallowed their
repugnance of attending a purely statist function, (not to
mention repugnance of the food served there) were RLA’ers and
openly wore black flag buttons. Besides myself, Ron Kimberling
of California and Marshall Beerwinkle of Texas were present.
Two more left anarchists. Sissy Kelly of D.C. and Joost van Nimis
(International Delegate who attended Dartmouth) put on RLA
buttons during the Conference. All were on different task forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first a libertarian caucus was considered and rudimentary
efforts were made to create it. To our surprise, the formation of
an Anarchist Caucus was announced, and so, the RLA’ers trudged
through the snow to the outlying cabin where the meeting was to
be held. The meeting was called by a press delegate of a
University of California paper, and attended by &lt;em&gt;Village
Voice&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; reporters. No concrete proposals
emerged from the ten people there, but much joyful chemistry
was in evidence; nor did anyone stay around for the Free
Enterprise Caucus that was to follow in that cabin. Most of the
group broke off to attend the Press Conference where the
aforementioned chemistry acted as a crap-repellent. Those
interested in the details of the Press Conference can contact Ron
Kimberling, c/o CLA, Box 572, Santa Ana, Cal. RLA attendance
of the Task Force meetings with the exception of two converts,
was poor, but coffeehouse attendance, where acid rock light
shows were held, was excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The libertarian delegates spent most of their time with
delegates interested in libertarianism. Some libertarian influence
was exhibited in the Preamble and Report of the draft Task
Force. The Drug Task Force advocated legalization and regulation
of marijuana, and the right to use other drugs coupled
with &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; persecution of dealers, split libertarian ranks. I
made my only address to the Assembly: an impassioned attack on
regulations and control. The remaining libertarians felt their
personal safety from arrest was more important than battling for
principle, and quietly voted for the Report. No other measure
evoked action by RLA at the Conference, and voting was split on
other issues. On example of this was the Vietnam
recommendation demanding complete American withdrawal but
massive US aid in “reparations” which I felt was continuing
Imperialism in a more “accepted” guise. Fortunately another
decade must pass before the State will hold another White House
Co-opt of Youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;By Samuel Konkin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth trembled. An edifice of the State shattered. And an individual’s sovereign
life ceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment was filled with the elements of low drama; tragedy, irony, fatal error,
cloak and dagger, terror in the dark of the night, Maquis sabotage, of the oppressive
police state or a despicable act of evil by a band of crazed criminals, depending on
your viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truck with the bomb was heisted from a professor known to be sympathetic to
student revolution; it was totally demolished by the blast. The call to the pigs of
warning, at 3:4O AM, was only two minutes before the premature explosion, but, even if
it had been longer, The City pigs admitted, they would not be able to warn the late-working
 Graduate Students in the physics building Sterling Hall, which is affixed to
the primary target, the Army Math Research Center. Only the University police could
warn them by jurisdiction, and they had to be contacted first. The alleged bombers, it
turned out, were assisted by the same State jealousy as the Canadian Mounties who had
them under surveillance were unable to hold them because the Federal warrants were for
non-extraditable crimes, and Wisconsin State warrants were needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Army Math Research Center (AMRC) was supposedly attacked as a tool of oppression
 of the Vietnamese people. The connection was extremely Tenuous, as the AMRC published
its work openly, and it was almost pure research. One last irony: Robert Fassnacht, the
fatal victim, was known as an opponent of American intervention in Viet Nam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was dancing in the streets in the “hippie”
Mifflin Street area, followed by hot, guilty, denials
of it when the death was learned. The rest of the
reactions were horrifyingly predictable. The State’s
rulers screamed over the slap in the face—destruction
 of the State’s sacred “property” &amp;amp; incidentally,
the murder of an innocent student. Conservatives rejoiced
 in the imminent gain in votes as the September
primary approached; Liberals talked law and order defensively,
 or charged the Right with blowing up the
Center to gain from the BACKLASH. Objectivist-oriented
students wailed over the loss of research papers (which
they expected, were to be safe under the State’s protection)
 and over the loss of life. The underground
paper, &lt;em&gt;Kaleidoscope,&lt;/em&gt; printed a statement by the “New
Year’s Gang” giving their reasons for the attack—assuming
 such a gang existed. The Editor went to jail
rather than even verify the authenticity
of his article before a Grand Jury, let alone
“compromise his source of information” as he claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RLA-symps at the University of Wisconsin had, as usual, the radical dissenting
view. “No, our erstwhile comrades in YAF &amp;amp; SIL, there was no “property” destroyed”, we
said. “And no, Weatherman, we do not rejoice at your supposed service to your pet pigs—Castro,
 Dong, et al. If a true, Free, “People’s Court” existed, you would be fortunate
to escape with conviction on charges of criminal negligence, and be justly spending your
lives reimbursing the wife and children of your “casualty”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an absolute right to life has been violated. There is only one objective result
of your act. Robert Fassnacht is dead. And if there were real Justice to be obtained,
Governor Khowles &amp;amp; Senator Proxmire, you would be sued for your gratuitous smear of attributing
 this act to “Anarchists and Anarchism”. Your sudden respect for life is obscene
in its hypocrisy. We anarchists here in Madison, it seems, are the only ones left who
have consistently strived for life’s continuance &amp;amp; fulfillment; &amp;amp; we shall continue to
struggle against its enemies: the guns of the State, and the bombs of the would-be STATE. THE END.&lt;/p&gt;
