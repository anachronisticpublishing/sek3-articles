&lt;h2&gt;Edited for New Libertarian participation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;by Samuel Edward Konkin III&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before 1969&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1969, there was no “organized” Libertarian Movement.
In the 1800s, circles formed around Lysander Spooner’s individualist abolitionism
in Massachusetts, followed by Benjamin Tucker and his &lt;em&gt;Liberty&lt;/em&gt; magazine
(not to be confused with the Seattle ’zine of the 1980s &amp;amp; 1990s) which
upheld the black banner of individualist anarchy from 1870s to 1907. In
that year, the entire stock of back issues and books were burned and Tucker
left America to live obscurely in France until his death in 1939.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orgy of statism peaked first with World War I and then receded. Randolph
Bourne uttered the memorable line, “War is the health of the State”
just before his death in 1918 and the Roaring Twenties saw a brief revival
of freedom. The two main spokesmen were Albert Jay Nock and his &lt;em&gt;Freeman&lt;/em&gt;
magazine (where Suzanne LaFollette first came to prominence) from 1920-24,
and then H.L. Mencken and his &lt;em&gt;American Mercury&lt;/em&gt; in the late 1920s
and through the 1930s until the approach of the second statist orgasm, World
War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nock’s student, Frank Chodorov, was responsible for the first proto-libertarian
student organization in the 1950s, the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists
(still around, but now called the Intercollegiate Studies Institute). Murray
Rothbard, a political fan of Chodorov (but disagreeing with his Georgist
deviation on “The Land Question”), formed the Circle Bastiat in
the late 1950s after being purged from William Buckley’s &lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt;.
(Buckley was a fan of Nock himself, and had described himself as a “philosophical
anarchist” before anointing himself the avatar of modern American conservatism,
having “seen a Dream Walking.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert LeFevre and Leonard Read, like Rothbard and Chodorov, evolved from
the “Old Right” alliance against the ultra-statist New Deal war
machine of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Classical liberals (like John T. Flynn)
and anarchists and even socialists like Norman Thomas joined in the great
America First crusade against U.S. imperialism between 1939 and 1941 with
never less than 80% of the people behind them... until Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeFevre had a fling at running for Congress with the likes of Richard Nixon
in 1948, but soon realized that one could not build a movement for freedom
without first re-informing the American people what freedom was, something
they had lost in five decades of non-stop statism. He formed the Freedom
School in Colorado and his youthful graduates became the original activists
in the student movement. Older people attended Read’s Foundation for Economic
Education in upstate New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothbard was attracted to the growing student movement and actually entered
the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) with his small following. He
broke with those libertarians still clinging to an alliance with the anti-New-Deal
Right by opposing Barry Goldwater in 1964 and beginning publication of &lt;em&gt;Left
&amp;amp; Right&lt;/em&gt; in 1965. He actively attended New Left meetings, wrote for &lt;em&gt;Ramparts&lt;/em&gt;
magazine, and even formed tactical alliances at the Freedom &amp;amp; Peace
Party conventions with Maoists against old-line socialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeFevre’s students began the &lt;em&gt;Libertarian American&lt;/em&gt; in Texas and &lt;em&gt;Liberal
Innovator&lt;/em&gt; (then just &lt;em&gt;Innovator&lt;/em&gt;) in California but, when Kerry
Thornley became editor, also pursued a pro-New Left alliance. The Innovator
leafletted Goldwater delegates at the 1964 Republican Convention at the
San Francisco Cow Palace. Innovator also published the first articles concerning
underground market activity which was later to be known as Counter-Economics.
Alas, the Innovator contributors went underground just as the Libertarian
Movement was about to explode aboveground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Rosenthal, Sharon Presley, Tom McGivern and others broke from the
Youth for Goldwater campaign to form the Alliance of Libertarian Activists,
the first explicitly libertarian activist organization at the end of 1964
at the University of California at Berkeley. Meanwhile, the earlier 1960
Youth for Goldwater which had reformed at Buckley’s Sharon, Connecticut
estate continued to attract libertarian students largely unaware of the
other groups. The new student group, Young Americans for Freedom, had one
libertarian chair, the founder, Bob Schuchman, who rejected the label “Young
Conservatives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, while the early libertarian activists following Rothbard and LeFevre
mostly fought on the side of the New Left, the later and much larger group
of hard-core campus activists who sympathized with liberty found themselves
on the opposite side in the largest anti-New Left group, YAF, in the summer
of 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Word About Ayn Rand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Tuccille’s claim (in his book title and elsewhere) that &lt;em&gt;It Usually
Begins with Ayn Rand&lt;/em&gt; was not accurate, but was indicative. Tuccille
himself joined Rothbard and others in the early pre-St. Louis attempt to
create a Libertarian movement out of YAF and SDS chapters, the Radical Libertarian
Alliance (RLA). Rand herself opposed independent political activism, always
supported Republican candidates (going back to Wendell Willkie) or no one,
and strongly rejected any association with libertarianism. She called her
followers Students of Objectivism and they operated on campuses independently.
(For example, at the University of Wisconsin in 1968-70, around 300 of them
were called Committee to Defend Individual Rights, or CDIR.) But it is true
that many YAF members were influenced by reading Rand, and chapters in Pennsylvania
and Maryland were openly Randist. Don Ernsberger and David Walters of Pennsylvania
formed the Libertarian Caucus within YAF with Dana Rohrabacher and Bill
Steele of California (LeFevrians). According to David Nolan of Colorado,
an earlier Libertarian Caucus was tried at the previous National YAF Convention
of 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Rand’s following who contributed to early libertarianism was
Jarrett B. Wollstein, who created &lt;em&gt;Students for Rational Individualism&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;The Rational Individualist&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Along with Rothbard’s new
&lt;em&gt;Libertarian,&lt;/em&gt; which he changed when he found the name was used by
an obscure newsletter to &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Forum,&lt;/em&gt; and LeFevre’s &lt;em&gt;Rampart
Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rational Individualist&lt;/em&gt; became the leading libertarian publication
until 1971. Also influenced by Rand was Lanny Friedlander, who began a fanzine
called &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for &lt;em&gt;RI&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rampart Journal&lt;/em&gt; was anarcho-objectivist
Roy Childs. Childs wrote an “Open Letter to Ayn Rand” which obtained
no response from her other than the usual purge for questioning her ideology.
But its case that objectivism lead naturally to free-market anarchy left
unanswered provided a conduit for many conversions to libertarianism by
such as philosopher and friend of Childs, George H. Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Ayn Rand split with her chief disciple, Nathaniel Branden, who
had run her activist organization, Nathaniel Branden Institute or NBI. Ex-objectivists
filled the ranks of YAF and SRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 1968, Rothbard attempted a Left-Right Anarchist supper club
in New York with anarchocommunist Murray Bookchin which lasted two meetings.
Rothbard was joined by the former speechwriter for Barry Goldwater, Karl
Hess, in &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Forum&lt;/em&gt; and in SDS activism. Hess went so far
as to join the Black Panthers; his article in early 1969 in &lt;em&gt;Playboy,&lt;/em&gt;
“The Death of Politics,” was second only to Robert A. Heinlein’s
&lt;em&gt;The Moon is A Harsh Mistress&lt;/em&gt; (published serially 1967-68) with its
portrayal of a largely successful libertarian revolution on the moon in
swelling the ranks of the about-to-be-born libertarian movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1969–1974&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Libertarian Movement has a golden age, it ran from August 1969 through
around August 1974. The SDS convention split several ways, purging the anarchists
before the other delegates even arrived. The Young Americans for Freedom
began purging racist and Randist chapters in July, and both sides, libertarians
and traditionalists or “trads,” engaged in “papering”
their chapters with members to maximize delegate strength in St. Louis for
the National Convention over the Labor Day Weekend. Assisting the libertarians
was the proximity of the World Science Fiction convention, also that weekend
in St. Louis, and the number of Heinlein fans who would be attending and
available to accept delegate status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trads, already in power, succeeded in stripping most of the libertarian
delegates of credentials, but about 200 hard-core libertarians retained
delegate status and many who came as trad supporters (such as the founding
editor of &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;)
switched to the Libertarian Caucus when they saw the repressive treatment
of the authoritarian trads. Agitating additionally was the small Anarchist
Caucus of RLA and the Student Libertarian Action Movement, or SLAM. The
AC peaked at about 30 delegates, and could not get more than that for self-styled
“philosophic anarchist” Michael Ingallinera. Karl Hess led a rally
under the famous St. Louis arch which was dispersed by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana Rohrabacher, the “Johnny Grass-Seed” of the Libertarian Caucus,
could not get more than 220 votes and was most popular of the pure libertarians.
Harvey Hukari of Stanford, running independent of both the “National
Office” trad slate and the LC, did better but still could not win.
James Farley, claiming to be a libertarian running on the NO slate, on the
other hand, received the highest delegate vote total (around 500 out of
800). Samuel Edward Konkin III, a Wisconsin delegate, and his anarchist
friend Tony Warnock (both rightly suspected of having been won over by Rohrabacher
and Rothbard) found they had been replaced by alternates when they had gone
for a late breakfast, even though they arrived back an hour or more before
their state’s votes were to be declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most spectacular moment at the St. Louis YAF convention of 1969 occurred
when an AC member lit a xerox of his draft card in front of television cameras
and was attacked by YAF trads football-style. Libertarians tried to form
a line to protect him and the subsequent physical battle radicalized a lot
of “fusionist” libertarian-conservatives. Though some like Jared
Lobdell tried to mollify libertarians with a strong anti-draft minority
plank, and unopposed Chairman David Keene appealed to both sides for unity,
the purges continued after the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fall, the Libertarian Caucus and the Students for Rational Individualism
merged into the Students for Individual Liberty, dually based in Pennsylvania
and Maryland around Ernsberger/Walters and Wollstein/Childs. Rohrabacher
and Steele, after their purge, formed the California Libertarian Alliance,
and announced a huge convention in early 1970. Rothbard and Hess jumped
the gun with a Left-Right Conference at the Hotel Diplomat in October 1969
(Columbus Day Weekend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RLA conference did attract New Left individualists and former YAF anarchists,
but the free-marketeers stayed to hear Rothbard and his Circle Bastiat brothers,
Leonard Liggio and Joseph Peden, discuss economics and revisionist history,
while Hess led a contingent to join the March on Fort Dix of New Leftists.
When the latter returned pursued by FBI agents, the RLA collapsed and Rothbard
swung right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 1970, backed by Riqui and Seymour Leon of LeFevre’s relocated
Rampart Institute (in Santa Ana, California), the California Libertarian
Alliance hosted the Left-Right Festival of Mind Liberation at USC. Nearly
500 activists showed up to hear LeFevre, SDS former president Carl Oglesby,
Hess, Rohrabacher, SEK3, and most of the early activists. Press coverage
of libertarians (such as the con coverage in the LA &lt;em&gt;Free Press&lt;/em&gt;) was
growing, peaking with the 1971 color cover on the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
Magazine (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarian Alliances and SIL chapters spread to every major campus during
1970. The Madison, Wisconsin, UW Libertarian Alliance sprouted chapters
in neighboring high schools and started the newsletter, &lt;em&gt;Laissez Faire.&lt;/em&gt;
Its five issues were the first volume of what was to become &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;. During the Cambodia demonstrations
in May, UWLA rallied former YAFers and YIPpies and was attacked by both
National Guard tear gas units and Maoist Progressive Labor heavies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 1970, SEK3 established contacts with Eastern libertarians,
and brought Columbia students Stan Lehr and Lou Rossetto (now publisher
of &lt;em&gt;Wired)&lt;/em&gt; into the Movement. They formed the Columbia Freedom Conspiracy.
SEK3 moved to New York University and formed the NYU Libertarian Alliance,
changing the newsletter name to NYU/New Libertarian Notes (in ironic homage
to New Left Notes) and recruiting most of the NYU Science Fiction Society
as the kernel of NYULA. Quickly seeding LA’s on other campuses, he formed
the New York Libertarian Alliance, but in deference to the older group,
formed from the objectivist Metropolitan Young Republican Club (MYRC), called
by Gary Greenberg the New York Libertarian Association, NY LA was seldom
used publically, leaving “NYLA” to the association. NYLA was part
of SIL while the Libertarian Alliance was strongly identified with the California
LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYLA and the New York LA worked together on Libertarian Conferences such
as Freedom Conspiracy’s Columbia Libertarian Conference of 1971 where Milton
Friedman was confronted by SEK3 as to his responsibility for the withholding
feature of income tax. Friedman’s ready embrace of the “credit”
excused as needed to fight World War II (which was questioned by most of
the revisionist-historical libertarians there) discredited him and his Chicago
School throughout the Libertarian Movement and put Ludwig von Mises (and
Murray Rothbard)’s Austrian School of Economics in the forefront of free-market
theory. NYULA attended Mises Circle meetings at NYU and Mises was guest
of honor at subsequent East Coast Libertarian Conferences hosted by SIL
at Drexel Campus in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1972, &lt;em&gt;NYU Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt; had evolved from a mimeoed fanzine
into a typeset semi-prozine; with the growing infrequency of &lt;em&gt;The Radical
Individualist&lt;/em&gt; (now just &lt;em&gt;The Individualist)&lt;/em&gt; it became the major
cross-factional publication with its credo, “Everybody appearing in
this publications disagrees.” Still influential was SIL’s &lt;em&gt;SIL Notes,&lt;/em&gt;
but it too began skipping issues. In New York, RLA’s &lt;em&gt;Abolitionist&lt;/em&gt;
was expanded into &lt;em&gt;Outlook&lt;/em&gt; even as RLA changed its name to the Citizens
for a Restructured Republic (CRR) and abandoned Weatherman tactics for electoral
alliances. Rothbard urged support for Mark Hatfield or William Proxmire
as anti-war candidates, but when they were eliminated, he balked at supporting
George McGovern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the west coast, Rohrabacher, Leon and LeFevre published two issues of
&lt;em&gt;Pine Tree&lt;/em&gt; which became &lt;em&gt;Rap&lt;/em&gt; magazine. As usual, the California
Libertarians were far too early and hip for the rest of the movement or
the market. Most ambitiously, Leon Kaspersky tried to distribute a monthly
libertarian tabloid, &lt;em&gt;Protos&lt;/em&gt; but gave up. All failed within a year.
The earliest libertarian bookstore attempt was made by Berl Hubbel in Long
Beach, the prophetically-named Agora Black Market Bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanny Friedlander, based in Massachusetts, sold &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; to minarchist
(term coined by SEK3 in 1970 and appearing in &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; in 1972) Robert
Poole and anarchist Manny Klausner who along with objectivist philosopher
Tibor Machan moved it to California and relentlessly rightward, eventually
out of the Libertarian Movement altogether. It did achieve the highest circulation
of any publication calling itself libertarian at 10,000 (it continued to
grow after it embraced neoconservatism); second was Robert Kephart’s &lt;em&gt;Libertarian
Review&lt;/em&gt; which peaked at 7,000 under its subsequent ownership by Charles
Koch and control by Ed Crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published its cover story on Rossetto
&amp;amp; Lehr of Columbia. In 1972, Edith Efron referred to Libertarianism
as a third position distinguished from Liberal and Conservative in &lt;em&gt;TV
Guide.&lt;/em&gt; Libertarian media recognition began to drop because of a new
organization appearing in early 1972 to the near-universal scorn of the
highly anti-political and even revolutionary libertarian movement, the “Libertarian”
Party or LP. To everyone’s amazement, including the few LP supporters, it
won an electoral vote for its presidential candidate John Hospers, and its
vice-presidential candidate, Toni Nathan, the first woman to get an electoral
vote. As a reward for his defection from Virginia’s all-Nixon electoral
college delegation, Roger McBride was given the 1976 LP nomination and nearly
brought it back down to total obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 1972, Samuel Edward Konkin III and LP founder David Nolan debated
the morality of voting in &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian
Notes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real crucial election turned out to be the New York mayoral election
of 1973; SEK3 and the LA had agreed to join the Free Libertarian Party of
New York though explicitly urging the LP’s destruction; SEK3 won election
to the Executive Committee and promptly built a coalition of upstate minarchists
and Manhattan radicals who matched in strength the New York City “anarchists”
who were willing to oppose the state but embraced party politics: partyarchs
(also coined by SEK3 in NLN). The only campaign which all participated in
was Fran Youngstein for Mayor. Unfortunately, Murray Rothbard was attracted
to Youngstein and his scornful opposition to the LP (he supported Nixon
in ’72 as did Rand) ended. The NLN anarchists, who were Rothbardian in most
respects but adhered to the California Libertarian Alliance (LeFevre) anti-political
position as most consistent, were forced to split and walked out of the
1974 FLP Convention just as their coalition partners were winning control,
leaving a stalemate. However, enough won delegate status to the Dallas National
LP convention to ally with the moderate Reformers of E. Scott Royce who
ran against Edward H. Crane III and the Nolan National Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Royce’s defeat, Crane created an authoritarian machine and purged
several state newsletters as sympathetic to SEK3 and the “radical caucus.”
Those campus LAers who resisted the LP and the LPrc who worked outside the
party as a revived SLAM, now called for a New Libertarian Alliance which
was announced in 1974 after Dallas. As partyarchs geared up for the 1974
congressional elections (which produced nothing), the NLA surged up only
to go... underground. SEK3’s response to electoral politics was refusal to
pay taxes, obey regulations or in any way give the State vampire its blood
— Counter-Economics — combined with Libertarian Theory. In other words,
politically-aware black marketeers, or &lt;em&gt;agorists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1975–1980&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboveground, the Party was left with the dregs and vacillators of the Libertarian
Movement; underground the NLA built its counter-economy. But still another
factor entered in 1975: the vast fortunes of Charles and David Koch, and
the Cato Institute they endowed. Ed Crane, already in control of the LP,
became chair of Cato and disburser of funds. A complex of offices was set
up in San Francisco and Cato bought &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Review&lt;/em&gt; from Kephart,
keeping Roy Childs as editor but hiring Jeff Riggenbach to keep LR actually
running. Riggenbach wrote for NL as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Notes&lt;/em&gt;
had come a long way; it serialized an interview that J. Neil Schulman had
got with Robert A. Heinlein, the first such interviewed published in decades.
NLN’s circulation took off and it nearly hit a thousand at the 1974 World
Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C. with the final installment
of the Heinlein interview. In 1975, SEK3 finally gave up on the East and
with the hardest core (except for John Pachak, the long-time layout artist),
piled into a Toyota for a legendary three-week trip across the U.S. to relocate
in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between December 1976 and January 1978, SEK3 and those who had come from
New York with him (Andy Thornton, J. Neil Schulman, Bob Cohen) plus Southern
Californians like Victor Koman and Chris Schaefer put out &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian Weekly&lt;/em&gt; —
101 issues of NLW before finally retreating to monthly and less frequent
publication. Ironically, the publication with the best history of on-time
frequent publication (even better than &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; which delayed and skipped
several issues early in its publication career) burned itself out in weekly
production and never returned to regular on-time publication again. During
that time, NLW not only became the premier publication of anti-party libertarians
and “journal of record” of the Movement, but also took up the
cause of opposing “monocentrism,” the monopolization of the Libertarian
Movement by Koch money and power, the legendary “Kochtopus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as NLW sputtered down in frequency to just plain &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; magazine, Rothbard broke with the Kochtopus.
Relations between MNR and SEK3 were maximally strained during 1977 when
Rothbard joined the Kochtopus and moved to San Francisco. Rothbard was described
as the “Darth Vader” of the Movement (&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; had just
been released). Rothbard lashed back with his attack on the “space
cadets” of science-fiction oriented libertarians, and was attacked
himself within the LP by “space cadets” who labeled his faction
“grubeaters.” But Rothbard had a falling out during the 1980 Clark
for President campaign with Crane who controlled the campaign, and his “shares”
in Cato were confiscated by the other Board members. NL promptly supported
Rothbard in his cry, “They stole my shares” and relations were
largely repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Clark and his vice-presidential running mate, David Koch, did get
the highest number of votes ever for the LP (nearly 900,000) but at an incredible
cost per vote. And the few thousand votes Hospers had received in 1972 had
at least got him an electoral vote. The LP began its long decline. (Hospers
himself turned against the LP.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1981–1990&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Rothbard’s opposition to the Kochtopus, Crane’s control slipped
fast. Students for a Libertarian Society quickly collapsed and its handpicked
leader, Milton Mueller, dropped out of the Movement. Cato’s attempt to reach
out to Left-Liberals, &lt;em&gt;Inquiry&lt;/em&gt; magazine, plateaued in circulation
and was combined with &lt;em&gt;Libertarian Review, &lt;/em&gt;which could not break the
5,000 level of circulation. At the 1983 LP National convention, Crane lost
a close battle with the combined Right-Center coalition who put California
state apparatchik David Bergland up against CFR member turned mild isolationist,
Earl Ravenal. Koch’s money was pulled out for the 1984 election and Ed Crane
turned on the Libertarian Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985, at the Libertarian International convention in Oslo, Norway,
Crane and Konkin were to debate the validity of the Libertarian Party for
libertarians. After SEK3’s demolition job, Crane got up and refused to defend
the party, even shaking Konkin’s hand. Alas, Crane was moving rightward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothbard, too, lost interest in the Libertarian Party with no one left
of consequence to fight over it. A feeble attempt was made to stop Rothbard’s
candidate, Republican U.S. Representative from Texas, Ron Paul, from getting
the 1988 nomination., mostly from the Association for Libertarian Feminists
(ALF) who strongly opposed him on abortion. When Paul’s vote continued the
decline from the Clark high, Rothbard blamed the “Left” Libertarians
(apparently still in the LP) and &lt;em&gt;luftmenschen&lt;/em&gt; with no visible means
of support (Agorists and other counter-economists?), and quit the party.
With Llewellyn Rockwell, Rothbard formed the Ludwig von Mises Institute
and announced an alliance with Rockford Institute’s Thomas Fleming and his
paleoconservatives as an attempt to revive the Old Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the LP declined schism by schism, the New Libertarian Alliance
sprouted to aboveground entities. In 1978, the Movement of the Libertarian
Left was formed out of remaining aboveground activists to restore and continue
the alliance Rothbard and Oglesby had begun between the New Left and Libertarians
against foreign intervention or imperialism. MLL’s internal newsletter was
&lt;em&gt;Tactics of the MLL&lt;/em&gt;; it also began a theoretical journal after the
publication of SEK3’s long-delayed &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;. The
responses by Rothbard, LeFevre, and anti-voting/anti-activist Erwin “Filthy
Pierre” Strauss and Konkin’s replies became the basis of &lt;em&gt;Strategy
of the New Libertarian Alliance #1. SNLA#2 &lt;/em&gt;began SEK3’s &lt;em&gt;Agorism &lt;/em&gt;Contra&lt;em&gt;
Marxism&lt;/em&gt; serialization and George Smith’s criticism of Rothbard’s “Leninist”
Libertarianism. Within a decade, Rothbard had swung right and the Berlin
Wall had fallen. (Agorism had made the East European Marxist journals and
was vigorously debated in the early 1980s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 31, 1984 The Agorist Institute
was formed on that symbolic date and with the logo of “the tip of the
iceberg.” So in 1985 MLL was turned over to Victor Koman and Mike Gunderloy
while SEK3, J. Kent Hastings and John Strang concentrated on AI. The &lt;em&gt;New Isolationist&lt;/em&gt; newsletter combined
the editorial skills and writings of Konkin and Royce, with Alexander Cockburn
and Noam Chomsky from the New Left, Thomas Fleming and Charles Reese from
the Old Right, and many other anti-interventionists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;
brought forth its long-awaited time capsule of the new generation of Science
Fiction Authors of the 1980s in 1990. The triple-sized issue, first with
a color cover, mutated into a tribute to Robert A. Heinlein who had just
died. Contributors included Robert Anton Wilson, Robert Shea, Victor Koman,
Brad Linaweaver, L. Neil Smith, J. Neil Schulman, Oyvind Myhre of Norway
and Chris Shaefer on the films based on Heinlein writings. Libertarian science-fiction
fans (frefen) had turned their parties into “Heinlein Wakes” in
the late 1980s, and that culminated in the largest, most international gathering
of libertarian writers at The Hague over the “Bank Holiday” weekend
in late August where NL All-SF Triple Issue premiered. Final copies were
not available until the NASFiC in San Diego the following weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Libertarian Party was in such bad shape that SEK3 called for a ceasefire
and re-direction of energy in the previous issue of NL; with the collapse
of the Berlin Wall, key libertarians “retired” to engage in a
personal life for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1991–Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; had drifted further and further away from mainstream, let
alone radical, libertarianism in the 1970s so that by 1985 only &lt;em&gt;Libertarian
Review&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New Libertarian&lt;/em&gt;
remained with plus-1000 circulations. When LR and &lt;em&gt;Inquiry&lt;/em&gt; quit, NL
was not left alone. Bill Bradford, a lifetime subscriber to NL, started
his own Centrist Libertarian magazine, &lt;em&gt;Liberty. &lt;/em&gt;Briefly, it was inclusive,
but soon it purged Rothbard and Konkin (Bradford claimed an Editorial Board
he created had the responsibility, not him) and it defined itself between
agorist/inclusive NL, paleolibertarian &lt;em&gt;Rothbard-Rockwell Report,&lt;/em&gt;
and the neoconservative &lt;em&gt;Reason.&lt;/em&gt; In 1991, &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt; under its
new editor Virginia Postrel crossed the line and became the only publication
to be viewed by some as libertarian to endorse the Gulf War. Even &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt;’s
former editor Robert Poole and Cato’s Ed Crane opposed the naked imperialist
maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the agorists returned to activism in 1994, they found a changed
Movement — but not victorious, as they had assumed it would be. &lt;em&gt;Liberty&lt;/em&gt;
was rehashing objectivism and Ayn Rand’s personal life over and over with
the vapid sneering attacks by cowardly nom-de-plume “Chester Alan Arthur”
substituting for political (or anti-political) analysis; the Libertarian
Party had run an out-and-out scoundrel and party-funds embezzler, Andre
Marrou, for President in 1992; Jeff Friedman was editing a “theoretical
journal” claiming that Libertarianism was based on Egalitarianism (one
of Murray Rothbard’s essays and book titles was &lt;em&gt;Egalitarianism as a Revolt
Against Nature)&lt;/em&gt; and embracing chunks of deconstructionism, postmodernism,
and even Liberalism; and, rather than rallying the demoralized, de-socialized
Left to the Libertarian (black) banner, nearly all factions were cozying
up to (different) parts of the already victorious and thus scornful statist
Right. Reason was gone completely from Libertarianism, as was &lt;em&gt;Reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Chris Hitchens and Alex Cockburn calling for a revived New Left/Libertarian
Alliance on CSPAN and in Left publications, SEK3 and the revived MLL answered
them positively with the pamphlet “What’s Left?” and subsequent
meetings of the Karl Hess Club (successor of the anti-Party Libertarian
Supper Club of Los Angeles and Albert J. Nock/H.L. Mencken Fora). But the
Original Gang Libertarian ranks thinned considerably. Robert LeFevre had
died in 1986; Karl Hess left us in 1994 and Murray Rothbard in January 1995.
The struggle for the minds (what was left of them) and hearts of the Libertarian
Movement was thus engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Isolationist&lt;/em&gt; revived first;
then the long-awaited &lt;em&gt;Agorist Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, the theoretical journal
of The Agorist Institute, challenged
J. Friedman’s &lt;em&gt;Critical Review&lt;/em&gt; and began the development of the foundations
of Counter-Economics and the rest of Agorism. Finally, &lt;em&gt;New
Libertarian&lt;/em&gt; returned to set the movement straight
again with NL187 in December 1996 (dated April 1997.) Deviationists, sell-outs
and compromisers fled in terror; the hard-core and unyielding defenders
of freedom, as well as those who had been shut out of dominant libertarian
publications for their individualist, non-conforming viewpoints, rejoiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they all turned into .PDF files (Adobe Acrobat™),
moved to the World Wide Web of libertarian cyberspace, and lived happily
ever after...&lt;/p&gt;
