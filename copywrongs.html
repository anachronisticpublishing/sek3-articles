            <h2>Copywrongs</h2>
<h4>Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<p>Having done every step of production in the publishing industry,
both for myself and others, I have one irrefutable empirical conclusion
 about the economic effect of copyrights on prices and wages:
nada. Zero. Nihil. So negligible you’d need a geiger counter to
measure it.</p>
<p>Before I move on to exactly what copyrights do have an impact
on, one may be interested as to why the praxeological negligibility
of this tariff. The answer is found in the peculiar nature of
publishing. There are big publishers and small publishers and very,
very few in between. For the Big Boys, royalties are a fraction of one
percent of multi-million press runs. They lose more money from
bureaucratic interstices and round-off error. The small publishers
are largely counter-economic and usually survive on donated
material or break-in writing; let the new writers worry about
copyrighting and reselling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are a very few cases of legal action in the
magazine world because of this disparity. The little ’zines have no
hope beating a rip-off and shrug it off after a perfunctory threat;
the Biggies rattle their corporate-lawyer sabres and nearly anyone
above ground quietly bows.</p>
<p>Book publishing is a small part of total publishing and there are
some middle-range publishers who do worry about the total cost
picture in marginal publishing cases. But now there are two kinds
of writers: Big Names and everyone else. Everyone Else is seldom
reprinted; copyrights have nothing to do with first printings
(economically). Big Names rake it in—but they also make a lot from
ever-higher bids for their next contract. And the lowered risk of not
selling out a reprint of a Big Name who has already sold out a print
run more than compensates paying the writing the extra fee.</p>
<p>So Big Names writers would lose something substantial if the
copyright privilege ceased enforcement. But Big Name writers are
an even smaller percentage of writers than Big Name Actors are of
actors. If they all vanished tomorrow, no one would notice (except
their friends, one hopes). Still, one may reasonably wonder if the
star system’s incentive can be done away with without the whole
pyramid collapsing. If any economic argument remains for
copyrights, it’s incentive.</p>
<p>Crap. As Don Marquis put in the words of Archy the Cockroach,
“Creative expression is the need of my soul.” And Archy banged his
head on typewriter key after typewriter key all night long to turn
out his columns—which Marquis cashed in. Writing as a medium of
expression will continue as long as someone has a burning need to
express. And if all they have to express is a need for second
payments and associated residuals, we’re all better off for not
reading it.</p>
<p>But, alas, the instant elimination of copyrights would have
negligible effect on the star system. While it would cut into the
lifelong gravy train of stellar scribes, it would have no effect, on
their biggest source of income: the contract for their next book (or
script, play or even magazine article or short story). That is where
the money is.</p>
<p>“You’re only as good as your last piece”—but you collect for that
on your next sale. Market decisions are made on anticipated sales.
Sounds like straight von Mises, right? (Another great writer who
profited little from copyrighting—but others are currently raking it
in from Ludwig’s privileged corpse—er, corpus.)</p>
<p>The point of all this vulgar praxeology is not just to clear the way
for the moral question. The market (praise be) is telling us
something. After all, both market human action and morality arise
from the same Natural Law.</p>
<p>In fact, let us clear out some more deadwood and red herrings
before we face the Great Moral Issue. First, if you abolish
copyrights, would great authors starve? Nope, in fact, the market
might open a trifle for new blood.</p>
<p>Would writers write if they did not get paid? Who says they
wouldn’t? There is no link between payment for writing and
copyrights. Royalties roll in (or, much more often, trickle in) long
after the next work is sold and the one after is in progress.</p>
<p>Is not a producer entitled to the fruit of his labour? Sure, that’s
why writers are paid. But if I make a copy of a shoe or a table or a
fireplace log (with my little copied axe), does the cobbler or wood-worker
 or woodchopper collect a royalty?</p>
<p>A. J. Galambos, bless his anarchoheart, attempted to take
copyrights and patents to their logical conclusion. Every time we
break a stick, Ug The First should collect a royalty. Ideas are property,
 he says; madness and chaos result.</p>
<p>Property is a concept extracted from nature by conceptual man
to designate the distribution of scarce goods—the entire material
world—among avaricious, competing egos. If I have an idea, you
may have the same idea and it takes nothing from me. Use yours as
you will and I do the same.</p>
<p>Ideas, to use the ‘au courant’ language of computer programmers,
 are the programmes; property is the data. Or, to use another
current cliche, ideas are the maps and cartography, and property is
the territory. The difference compares well to the differences between
 sex and talking about sex.</p>
<p>Would not ideas be repressed without the incentive (provided by
copyrights)? ‘Au contraire’ the biggest problem with ideas is the
delivery system. How do we get them to those marketeers who can
distribute them?</p>
<p>My ideas are pieces of what passes for my soul (or, if you prefer,
ego). Therefore, everytime someone adopts one of them, a little
piece of me has infected them. And for this I get paid, too! On top of
all that, I should be paid and paid and paid as they get staler and
staler?</p>
<p>If copyrights are such a drag, why and how did they evolve? Not
by the market process. Like all privileges, they were grants of the
king. The idea did not—could not—arise until Gutenberg’s printing
press and it coincided with the rise of royal divinity, and soon after,
the onslaught of mercantilism.</p>
<p>So who benefits from this privilege? There is an economic impact
I failed to mention earlier. It is, in Bastiat’s phrasing, the unseen.
Copyright is a Big publisher’s method, under cover of protecting artists,
 of restraint of trade. Yes, we’re talking monopoly.</p>
<p>For when the Corporation tosses its bone to the struggling writer,
and an occasional steak to the pampered tenth of a percent, it
receives an enforceable legal monopoly on the editing, typesetting,
printing, packaging, marketing (including advertising) and
sometimes even local distribution of that book or magazine. (In
magazines, it also has an exclusivity in layout vs other articles and
illustrations and published advertisements.) How’s that for vertical
integration and restraint of trade?</p>
<p>And so the system perpetuates, give or take a few counter-economic
 outlaws and some enterprising Taiwanese with good
smuggling connections.</p>
<p>Because copyrights permeate all mass media, Copyright is the
Rip-off That Dare Not Mention Its Name. The rot corrupting our entire
 communications market is so entrenched it will survive
nothing short of abolition of the State and its enforcement of
Copyright. Because the losers, small-name writers and all readers,
lose so little each, we are content—it seems—to be nickel-and-dime
plundered. Why worry about mosquito bites when we have the vampire
 gouges of income taxes and automobile tariffs?</p>
<p>Now for the central moral question: what first woke me up to the
problem that was the innocent viewer scenario. Consider the
following careful contractual construction.</p>
<p>Author Big and Publisher Bigger have contracts not to reveal a
word of what’s in some publication. Everyone on the staff, every
person in the step of production is contracted not to reveal a word.
All the distributors are covered and the advertising quotes only a
minimal amount of words. Every reader is, like Death Records in
Phantom of the Paradise, under contract, too; that is, every reader
who purchases the book or ’zine and thus interacts with someone
who is under contract—interacts in a voluntary trade and voluntary
 agreement.</p>
<p>No, I am not worried about the simultaneous creator; although
an obvious victim, he or she is rare, given sufficient complexity in
the work under questions. (However, some recent copyright decisions
 and the fact that the Dolly Parton case even got as far as a
serious trial—means the corruption is spreading.)</p>
<p>One day you and I walk into a room—invited but without even
mention of a contract—and the publication lies open on a table.
Photons leap from the pages to our eyes and our hapless brain processes
 the information. Utterly innocent, having committed no
volitional act, we are copyright violators. We have unintentionally
embarked on a life of privacy.</p>
<p>And God or the Market help us if we now try to act on the ideas
now in our mind or to reveal this unintended guilty secret in any
way. The State shall strike us—save only if Author Big and
Publisher Bigger decide in their tyrannous mercy that we are too
small and not worth the trouble.</p>
<p>For if we use the ideas or repeat or reprint them, even as part of
our own larger creation—bang! There goes the monopoly. And so
each and every innocent viewer must be suppressed.</p>
<p>By the Market? Hardly. The entire contractual agreement falls
like a house of cards when the innocent gets his or her forbidden
view. No, copyright has nothing to do with creativity, incentive,
just desserts, fruits of labour or any other element of the moral,
free market.</p>
<p>It is a creature of the State, the Vampire’s little bat. And, as far as
I’m concerned, the word should be copywrong.</p>
