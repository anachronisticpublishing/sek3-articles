            <h2>A Cram History of the Libertarian Movement. Part II Post-1969</h2>
<h4>Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<p>The summer of 1969 will be remembered as the sprouting of the modern libertarian
movement. The Objectivists were in turmoil over Branden’s ouster, and many were being
 picked up by Wollstein’s anarcho-objectivist Society for Rational Individualism
(SRI). The seeds of libertarian caucus organization in YAF after the 1967 convention
came to flower in the libertarian takeover of Pennsylvania and California state YAF’s
with Rothbard’s influence putting a few anarchists into the New York State group, and
Karl Hess’s son in Virginia another small group. Many of these Rothbardians, organizing
 into the Radical Libertarian Alliance, attended the SDS National Convention.
Anarchists were being purged before the convention even began, and the group which
had been organized by decentralists, community control advocates and anarchists, ended
 up with nought but the Revolutionary Youth Movement and the Progressive Labor Party,
 not to mention a few Independent Socialists. The first order of business was the
purge of the IS, then the PL. Unfortunately, PL had stacked the Convention too well,
and RYM found itself out-voted. Like good democrats, they rejected the majority decision
 and ran off to grab the National Office files. Each group called itself the
one and only SDS. SDS-RYM promptly split again into RYM-I (Weatherman) and RYM-II
(Bay Area Revolutionary Union, mostly). The RLA and their new friends, the Student
Libertarian Action Movement, went home, with three SDS chapters (including Lysander
Spooner SDS) to add to their disillusioned YAF chapters into RLA. Now, they thought,
for the YAF convention, let us try to organize an Anarchist Caucus. And they did,
writing aboard Karl Hess’s yacht, the <em>Tranquil,</em> the Tranquil Statement, for enlightenment
 of the YAF average delegate.</p>
<p>But purges were underway in YAF. First, Wallacism had to go, especially as it
was being succeeded by Willis Carto’s real racism, and Yockeyite neo-nazism. Some
libertarians who supported this action became uneasy when Objectivist chapters were
purged next. Then came the dismissal of the Pennsylvania and California State Offices.
 Needless to say, the libertarians rose up angrily, and Libertarian Caucus mailings
 began to appear across the country with appeals for delegates to overturn the
rulings. In Wisconsin, where David Keene awaited his inevitable succession to the
National Chairmanship (with, I might add, LC endorsement!), the author of this paper
sat blissfully unaware of anything but rumors of malcontents and subversives, and accepted
 a delegate status (as the token Canadian?) with the understanding that Keene
was to be it.</p>
<p>Arriving at St. Louis, Labor Day, 1969, your author was as interested in the St.
Louis World Science Fiction Convention as much as the national YAF convention. But
the meeting with Dana Rohrabacher of California and Don Ernsberger of Pennsylvania,
the ousted LC leaders, instructed one as to the perfidies of the National Office.
The Wisconsin delegation broke, and I and my roommate found our vote for the key Executive
 Committee positions wrested from us through parliamentarianism. We were more
“in” with the establishment than were many of the 100 LCers who lost their credentials
 battles, and regained our votes for the Issues, but by then the votes were_running
 700 to 200 against us. Michael Ingallinera of Virginia, who ran as a “Philosophical
 Anarchist“ received 50, which was the maximum strength of the Anarchist Caucus,
 Rohrabacher got around 250 which was the maximum non-purged LC strength. Then
one of the AC lit a Xerox copy of his draft card before a television camera. The
Traditionalists tried to annihilate him physically, and he was protected by a living
shield of libertarians. Radicalization had set in, and the RLA-SLAM people had found
their mission: <em>agents provacateurs.</em> Many of us went home, convinced by Keene that
justice would triumph and the splits would be healed. Come 1971, why, we would <em>really</em>
 be organized.</p>
<p>The Trads retained control of both California and Pennsylvania, and Ernsberger’s
group joined Wollstein’s SRI to form the Society for Individual Liberty (SIL). The
Rohrabacher wing formed the California Libertarian Alliance,
and Dana travelled around the country, seeding local LA’s with ex-YAFers. Your author
 foundedh the University of Wisconsin LA in late 1969, and the Wisconsin LA the
following summer. Meanwhile, many of us went to New York for the first Libertarian
Conference, held Columbus Day, and featuring Rothbard and Hess.</p>
<p>But strange things had happened to the Trad speechwriter for Barry Goldwater
who had gone Objectivist, then joined the Constitutional Alliance of Oakley Bramble,
and finally rediscovered the Taftites camped out in New York. Murray Rothbard had
tried to carry the Word in <em>Left and Right,</em> but finally gave that up for the <em>Libertarian
 Forum</em> (nee <em>Libertarian</em>) and Hess became the Washington editor. Hess wrote an
article for <em>Playboy</em>, “The Death of Politics,” which came to be one of the major recruiting
 tools of the movement. But almost as it was printed, his fascination with
the Leftists that Murray had formed tactical alliances with led him to repudiate
most of it, and attempt to work with the Black Panthers.</p>
<p>The ex-SDSers and YAFers met each other at the conference and promptly split
into a group which followed Hess into an attack on Fort Dix, and a group which
stayed around to hear Murray discuss economics and Revisionist History. Some of us
were a bit skeptical of our viability at the time, but nevertheless, this author, at
least, became an anarchist at that time. In February, 1970 Dana staged a California
libertarian conference, again “Left-Right,“ which had 500 people and amazing harmony
between anarcho-capitalists and anarcho-communists. Fired up at this success, we
returned to our homes to organize.</p>
<p>Later that year, this author moved to New York—interestingly enough, so did
the action. The RLA, rent by the Hessian defections to the Far Left, began to whither,
 and their <em>Abolitionist</em> watered itself down until it became the modern wishy-washy
<em>Outlook.</em> SIL’s <em>Individualist</em> schedule became more erratic, although their <em>SIL
News,</em> handled directly by Ernsberger, remained regular. CLA’s venture into slick
publishing, financed by Robert LeFevre’s Rampart College, went two issues as <em>Pine
Tree,</em> two more as <em>Rap,</em> and folded. LeFevre, a pacifist “autarhist” began to lose
contributors from his more conservative older followers worried about this influx of,
and support for, long-hairs and weirdos. Rohrabacher has recently returned to activism
 in California and the sagging movement is coming alive again.</p>
<p>Down in Arizona, the Student Libertarian Action Movement was embattled by
street fighting with the State, followed by court cases (which SLAM won). That was
immediately followed by a Split into SLAM and the North American Libertarian Alliance,
 which coughed up two issues of <em>Sunburst,</em> folded, and was resurrected as a Social
 Revolutionary Anarchist Federation local (SRAF is the Left anarchist grouping).
SLAM devolved to just putting out the <em>Match!,</em> which Fred Woodworth continues to do.
Meanwhile, in New York, as SIL and RLA waned, Gary Greenberg’s New York Libertarian
Association was joined by this author’s New York Libertarian Alliance, and LA’s were
formed on all Manhattan campuses by early 1972, and several others outside of Manhattan.
 <em>New Libertarian Notes,</em> originally a pronunciation pun on <em>NYU Libertarian
Notes,</em> expanded to cover the East Coast movement. Then came the Libertarian Party.</p>
<p>With the exception of the defeat of the old Preform-Inform crowd’s attempt to
build a new country in the North Sea (which was carved up by Britain, Norway and
Denmark) and their subsequent retreat to nomadism and troglodytism (<em>Vonulife</em>), no
bigger setback hit the libertarian movement in a decade. The Libertarian Alliance’s
attempt to bring together all libertarians, limited archist or anarchist, left or
right, pro-political party and voting or revolutionary, voter-boycotting, or whatever,
 collapsed. Defections to the Party with the realization that <em>it</em> and <em>its</em> positions
 would be identified in the popular mind as what libertarianism was, regardless
of how conservative and statist it was, forced us into an anti-party tactic. First,
an anti-party group was needed to attract people turned off by the Party.
Thus was SLAM reborn in New York. Secondly, a method of reaching the semi-converted
attached to the Party, and exposing them to real libertarianism was needed. At the
moment, organization has begun on a Libertarian Party Radical Caucus. In New York,
the State group has already worked to co-opt us, this
author finding himself on the State Committee/Executive Committee of the Free Libertarian
 Party. LPRC is obviously pictured as analogous to the YAF LC, and it will
be interesting to see if the LP goes in for purges, etc. or some more sophisticated
sell-out and suppression approach.</p>
<p>This is where you find yourself now. And, as you can deduce, this is where <em>I</em>
came in!</p>
