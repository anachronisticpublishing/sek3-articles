            <h4>Samuel E. Konkin, 3rd</h4>
<h2>Libertarian Strategy</h2>
<p>Among the myriad programs for reform, revolution,
 emigration, and escape underground, into
the forests, in and under the ocean and to outer
space, the Libertarian Caucus Technique (LCT)
stands out for one distinguishing characteristic:
it has been observed to work.</p>
<p>This paper is not a whole-cloth fabrication
or an attempt to apply other modes of successful
anti-State action to libertarian requirements.
This paper rather puts forward the underlying
principles behind an already proven successful tactic
 so that it may be systematically applied and
used where appropriate and necessary.</p>
<p>Like all plans leading to battle, the LCT can
be thwarted, and the troops can lose themselves in
the process. Since you are fighting for the minds,
hearts and souls of others, that is what you are
laying on the line.</p>
<p>The key to success of a Libertarian Caucus is
<em>strategic infiltration.</em> The terms sound cold and
calculated and are meant to. Failure to trigger
the strategy at the appropriate time—regardless
of personal feelings—will blow the technique.
It’s not for the soft-hearted.</p>
<p>Finally, LCT is political judo. The pivot
is the “sanction of the victim,” the always-present
vulnerable spot in the State apparatus. Like all
forms of judo, it requires the opponent coming to
you and throwing his weight. You merely adjust the
direction of his trajectory so that he lands flat
on his back, rather than on top of you.</p>
<p>That requires patience and detachment. The
strategic infiltrator can never force the issue,
nor can he initiate action (beyond setting up the
LC). He must always <em>respond,</em> react to the issues
that the opposition gives him. Of course, he can
be incredibly adept discovering issues where others
may not have noticed them. But ego-tripping “leadership”
 just doesn’t work.</p>
<h3>The Libertarian Caucus</h3>
<p>Caucus technique is an old political
trick, much more prevalent on the Left in the
U.S., but cross-spectrum in parliamentary
countries. A caucus is simply a gathering of
vote-holders <em>within</em> a larger voting bloc. A
<em>bloc</em> or coalition in parliamentary countries votes
to keep itself in power. The parties themselves
go “into caucus,” but usually they have separate
internal caucuses representing their ideological
sources of strength. (Notice how close the idea
is to the “sanction of the victim.“)</p>
<p>The Conservative Party of Great Britain has
a “Monday Club” of free enterprise right-wingers
who form a caucus to exert pressure on the Party
to maintain ideology in the face of pragmatism.
The Labour Party has the Tribune Group which does
the same for Leftist ideological purity. The Free
Democrats of Germany had both a Left-caucus and
a National Liberal Action Right-caucus, though the
leaders of the latter have dropped out and joined
the Christian Democrats. The Italian Christian
Democrats are heavily faction-ridden, and their
Left-caucus seeks coalition with Communists while
their Right-caucus contemplates the neo-fascists.</p>
<p>In the U.S., one could think of parliamentary
examples such as the Wednesday Club, Conservative
Study Group, Black Democratic Caucus and so on.</p>
<p>The Students for a Democratic Society, which
was an umbrella group of the New Left, was loaded
with caucuses: Worker-Student Alliance, Revolutionary
 Youth Movement, Anarchist Caucus, Independent
 Socialist Caucus, several Trotskyite caucuses,
 and so on.</p>
<p>A caucus serves two functions: one for the
group as a whole, the other for the caucus members.
 It serves the former by keeping the caucused
 faction pacified and part of the group, and
it serves the latter by putting forward their position
 in hopes of making it the dominant one.
The first function is realistic and obviously
works, at least for a time. The latter is not and
does not.</p>
<p>Caucuses which capture temporary control
of the American political parties have either gone
down to defeat (William Jennings Bryan for the
Populists, George McGovern for the radiclibs),
sold out (Thomas Jefferson for the Old Republicans,
 Abe Lincoln for the Free Soilers), Or both
(Barry Goldwater for the conservatives). In a
case by itself was the takeover of the Peace and
Freedom Party by the California “Libertarian” Alliance,
 where the CLA ended up with a corpse.</p>
<p>Perhaps a group simply organized for taking
over a Party would succeed—except that such a
“Power Caucus” would not fulfill the first function
 of gaining the sanction of some principally
principled victims. Contradiction.</p>
<p>To defeat this <em>real</em> contradiction, the apparent
 one is given up. The strategists of the
Libertarian Caucus enter with the full understanding
 that they will not take power. In fact,
the <em>less</em> influence they seem to have, the better
for the strategy!</p>
<h3>Strategic Goal of the LCT</h3>
<p>The goal of libertarian activists is the
construction of a viable libertarian society. A
viable libertarian society is a collection of individuals
 who possess the following characteristics:
 rejection of all claims to their lives and
property, refusal to subjugate their selves (egos)
into a collective, and acceptance of an alliance
with other individuals possessing the first two
characteristics for purposes of defense. Any given
individual in a libertarian society need not possess
 these characteristics; but it is <em>necessary</em>
that a sufficient number do to fulfill the goal.</p>
<p>I need not belabor what is obvious at this
point: libertarianism cannot be imposed from the
top down. <em>Failure</em> to <em>impose</em> libertarianism is,
in fact, a measure of <em>success</em> of libertarianism.
Contradiction.</p>
<p>Such collectives as political parties and
related ideological organizations and pressure
groups operate counter to the libertarian’s goals.
Thus, the strategic infiltrator has an incomparable
advantage if he is a libertarian: he does not
fear the destruction of the collective he is infiltrating.
 In fact, he welcomes it.</p>
<p>With this point driven home, one must point
out that the short-term or even medium-range survival
 of the infiltrated group is a lesser consequence
 to the strategic infiltrator than his
primary goal: to create libertarians, to add
to his ranks of allies.</p>
<p>Therefore, the strategic infiltrator employs
those tactics which foster rejection of the collectivist
 ethic, which encourage rejection of
self-sacrifice, and which raise the consciousness
of the non-aware members to see the concealed
fraud and coercion starkly.</p>
<p>The Party members are put through a trauma
where they must choose between alternatives which
they earlier felt were compatible. At one of
these crises, the member will reject membership
or embrace it without further reservation. The
latter will join the ranks of the enemy. The
former, if exposed to libertarian thought along
the way, may finally raise their consciousness
 to your level and join you, or work for
your ends on their own.</p>
<p>Some will basically go into shock from the
trauma, and simply “Browne out.” They reject the
reality of the choice but cannot maintain the
evasion that the choice is not real. They shut
down their brains.</p>
<h3>Some Tactics for the Libertarian Caucus Technique</h3>
<p>The tactics you work out for use of the
LCT are specific to the group you are in.
Clearly, a tactic for use in the Student Mobilization
 Committee Against the War etc. will be
different from one usable in the John Birch Society.
 On the other hand, some tactics in the
Democratic Party infiltration may be applicable
to Republican Party infiltration.</p>
<p>Let’s run through some historical examples
and see what worked. The first case attempted
never got off the ground, i.e., the RLA infiltration
 of SDS. The second case, the RLA infiltration
 of YAF, was incredibly successful.</p>
<p>The infiltrators set up an Anarchist Caucus
 (AC) to explicitly push the hard-core, pure
libertarian position. However, the action was
really fought in the “Libertarian” Caucus, where
those who felt libertarians could work with the
conservative Statists were to be found in large
numbers. The “agit-prop” before the Con raised
the consciousness of the target group. The
literature distributed at the St. Louis Convention
 was a deliberate incitement to the “Trads”
(traditionalist conservatives)—<em>The Tranquil
Statement</em> of the RLA, <em>The Match!</em> from SLAM, and
Rothbard’s “Listen YAF” in <em>The Libertarian Forum.</em>
Rothbard explicitly begins his agitation by
calling for a Schism—equivalent to “seizing the
high ground” in military terms.</p>
<p>The AC brought Karl Hess to speak under the
Arch. Some trad called the cops to break up the
gathering. The AC exploited their put-upon image
and challenged Buckley to debate Hess. Buckley
refused, and the AC now had evidence to
back their claims that the conservative Trads
wanted no compromise with the libertarians. A
defection from the LC slate to the Trad National
Office slate was picked up and used as evidence
that one could not be in both camps.</p>
<p>Still, when <em>the</em> issue came up, the Trads
throttled back their own hard-liners to pass a
wishy-washy position on conscription to give
the LCers hope of victory “next time.” The AC
struck back with a hard-core position on the draft,
which actually got through committee with some
sympathetic help to become a minority plank.
When it became obvious the delegates were willing
 to accept compromise over schism, one AC
provocateur ignited what appeared to be his
draft card. A simple act—but a contradiction
with the compromise being voted. The resulting
polarisation, split of YAF, and formation of the
modern libertarian movement is well-known, but
the strategic infiltration is not.</p>
<p>A couple of early attempts by myself to
convert what I observed in St. Louis into a
science brought inconclusive results—a split in
the Anti-War in Cambodia marchers, and the Anarchist
 Caucus at a Wisconsin Young Republican
Convention. A move into the Wisconsin Alliance
(a new Leftist party) showed signs of bearing
fruit but could not be completed as I left for
New York. Just to keep in practice, I split
up a YIP chapter at U.W.</p>
<p>In New York, various anti-war groups were
infiltrated, but with the exception of the War
Tax Resistors, we met with little success. The
reason is that we had no common identity with
those whom we were seeking to win over. Our
vast differences made it nearly impossible to
have the “better crowd“ see us as articulating
their positions consistently, so the power-trippers
could appear closer to them. (We did pick up a
few anarcho-Leftists at a rally when we started
a chant against a Trotskyist Speaker of “Remember
 Kronstadt! Trotsky was a butcher!”)</p>
<p>Then came the classic success story of
strategic infiltration, the break-up of the “Libertarian”
 Party. I followed the above formula
rigorously, with one error, though I knew at the
time I was rushing things.</p>
<p>By 1973, the emerging LP had created the
image of a small band of anti-politicians on
the fringes of the movement, mostly Browne-outs,
coral reefers and pacifists, impotent against the
politicians. Two years later, the <em>radical caucus</em>
had succeeded in restoring the anti-political wing
of the libertarian movement to at least equal status
 with the politicians (e.g., <em>Libertarian Review</em>’s
“Essay Review” debate between Crane and myself),
the hard-core, consistent position was conceded to
be (or feared to be when not conceded) on the anti-political
 side, and Party members were purged,
shunned and attacked for merely having associated
with the powerful and deadly <em>rc</em> and myself—a
witch-hunt in the classic tradition.</p>
<p>[TODO: Should we link with LR’s article? —dig.ed.]</p>
<p>The details of how it was done are in <em>New
Libertarian Notes,</em> especially issues # 32 &amp; 33;
I have no intention of repeating them here.
Those reading this publication and seeing the
events of 1974 from Hr. Royce’s view now have
the answer to their common question. “But what
was Konkin after?”</p>
<p>[TODO: Definitely link NLN when have. —dig.ed.]</p>
<h3>The Costs of Strategic Infiltration</h3>
<p>One has to choose between friends, who will
not ally, and allies who just aren’t going to
make good Friends. I did, with regrets, perhaps.</p>
<p>One has to be ready to turn everything into
a success. When the “establishment” (call it
National Office, call it Trads, call it “Partyarchy,”
 call it bosses—but make sure to delineate
a clear, strong, visible enemy) defeats your issue
for more principles, charge them with repression.
When they accept your reforms, charge them with a
co-opt—and immediately hike your demand. The
establishment can do no right—which is, in fact,
one of the truths you are trying to convey. <em>Do
not ever lose sight of this</em>—never start thinking
that you have a chance to win the enemy over, and
that they can’t be such bad guys. Then <em>their</em>
caucus function is working.</p>
<p>One must be ready to smash what one has built.
In November 1973, the disaster of the Youngstein
campaign swelled the ranks of the <em>radical caucus</em>
anti-Partyarchy ranks to the point where I foresaw
victory for the reformers at the next convention
in Spring. I thus resigned. (Two years later
they took over and drove Rothbard out—but without
the hard-core in their ranks.)</p>
<p>Can others be trusted not to “sell out” if
they organize a “strategic Infiltration”? Well,
if they have the benefit of watchful support that
I had in the LP such as Andy Thornton, Neil Schulman,
 Abby Goldsmith and others right in the inner
circle, maybe. It’s a real risk.</p>
<p>Can this strategy work, say, in the Republican
 Party? I think it can, at least at the lower
levels where the idealists man the ranks of pavement
 pounders. I have no inclination to pursue
the strategy any further for the foreseeable future.
But for those with strong constitutions, high
degrees of control over their emotions, and
strong stomachs for the political sewers, you’re
welcome to the ideas here. Let me know how you
do and we can compare notes.</p>
<p>Politics, as the great Frank Chodorov so
well analyzed, is the conflict over plunder yet
to come. Like him, I am willing to soil my hands
in this inescapably rotten, immoral game; and
again like him, I would welcome the day when our
scorn and derision will be sufficient to deal with
politics.</p>
<p>On that day, we shall have the free society
 for which we long.</p>
