            <h4>Samuel E. Konkin, 3rd</h4>
<h2>Separatism and Quebec</h2>
<p>Suppose, just across the state line from
where you live, secessionists had won an election
 taking over the local government. What would
your natural reaction be?</p>
<p>Well, if you’re a radical libertarian, you’d
probably jump in the air with a whoop! Then after
a fast jig over the imagined grave of the Federal
State, you’d call up all your anarchofriends and
tell them the good news. And then, I hope, you’d
try to find any local libertarians in the area
struggling for freedom, offer them whatever help
you could in pushing their cause on your side of
the line, and send them what you can spare.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So how come it didn’t happen?</p>
<p>Quebec is right across the border from New
York state. New York has from 1,000 to 20,000
libertarians, depending on the degree of activism
required for definition. True, most are at the
other end of the state from the province, but
for about $15 a bus ride or an afternoon’s drive,
one could get from New York City to Montréal. Yet
if there is a single libertarian in New York who
is involved with the Québec Separatist movement
beyond reading the recent election results in the
TIMES, your friendly neighborhood anarchocolumnist
has yet to hear of him.</p>
<p>Perhaps not so coincidentally, the Libertarian
Party’s dead hand lies heavier on the New York movement
 than anywhere else. And probably the most any
member thought of was that since the Separatists won
the election, well, what more is there to do? After
all, who can see beyond voting a Party into power?</p>
<p>Now all the rest of you libertarian revolutionaries-in-embryo
 out there may not be all that
much better. How many of you have heard that the
separatists’ Parti Québec is socialist? You can
put your hands down now. How many of you have
heard of the Parti Québec? How many of you can
see no relevance to the Péquiste (as the P.Q. members
are usually called) victory on Nov. 15 to your libertarian
 goals whatsoever?</p>
<p>Let’s start with that and work backwards. The
breaking up of a State—even just splitting it in
two—is a net gain for those who wish to see the
State abolished or even limited. After all, libertarians
 have supported secessionism since Lysander
Spooner. Even partyarchs support secessionism (in
their Platforms or other such Holy Writ). Rothbard
has written reams on national self-determination.</p>
<p>From a Counter-Economic view, just think of the
possibilities for smuggling, monetary speculations,
tax avoidance and regulation-evasion across three
borders rather than just one (Quebec-Canada. Canada-U.S.,
 U.S.-Quebec)! And the three borders would
meet at a point in the St. Lawrence River—right next
to New York state.</p>
<p>Surely this is a tremendous gain for the rational
 self-interest of every libertarian in North
America. And possibly around the world, for think
of what a shining example the Québecois—right up
against the center of world imperialism—would be to
the Welsh, the Biharans, the Basques, the Meos, the
Slovaks and Ruthenians, the Ukrainians, the Parsia,
and on and on in nearly every country in the world.</p>
<p>Imagine, as socialism managed to tie itself to
wars of “national” liberation, libertarianism was the
foundation of the struggles of minority separatist
movements around the globe. Think of Juan Carlos of
Spain denouncing the subversive influence of the Rothbardeneros;
 picture movie and TV clips of hard-eyed,
uniformed guerrillas in the jungles taking their lessons
 in classical Mises and clutching their little
black books!</p>
<p>The potential is, at least by now, obvious. Can
one get in touch with the Pequistes? What are they,
anyways, and how can we deal with them?</p>
<p>Working for the summer in Ottawa in 1967, I ob-
served a by-election across the river in Hull, Québec,
where the Ralliement Creditiste was running a strong
race against the Progressive Conservatives and the
Liberals (the socialists have no support in Québec;
they have yet to elect a single member to either federal
 or provincial legislature). Being still a proto-libertarian,
 I was a campus chairman of the University
of Alberta Social Credit Party, so I thought I’d drop
down to RC campaign headquarters and offer to assist
them.</p>
<p>I found the local Créditistes flattered at being
noticed, amused at my attempts to converse about our
common ideology in French; they gave me a few leaflets
to pass around and some literature. In short, they
don’t bite; they are not hard to get in touch with.</p>
<p>If the average American libertarian can restrain himself
 from remarks like “How much is that in real money?“
or “Can you speak white?” or “Sure is picturesque up
here in Kew-Beck; guess I don’t need my parka in July“,
he can probably communicate.</p>
<p>Obviously we will be in demand. The reason is
simple: the war of secession (cold or hot) will be
fought—not in Québec, or at least no longer there
being the decisive battleground—but in Central Canada
 and the United States. If the federal government
can be hamstrung by pro-Quebec and anti-interventionist
activists in the rest of Canada, maybe even sympathetic
groups starting out to Split Alberta and British Columbia
 off in the far west, Québec can win. And there is
always the threat of the Marines landing in Montréal.
(Don’t laugh; Canadians take that possibility very
seriously, and all that is needed to exert pressure on
the Péquistes is the <em>belief</em> that such action may be
taken: i.e., credibility.)</p>
<p>Finally, what can one expect from a Separatist
Quebec? Socialism? Yes and no. The first Separatist
 Party, formed about 1960, was leftist (I am not
even considering the 12-member FLQ even if they did
have a thing for bombs and kidnapping), and called
the Ralliement pour l’independence National (RIN).
(<em>National</em> in French and everywhere else in the world
but American English, does not mean Central or Federal;
 the <em>nation</em> is a supra-tribe and so a National
Party in Québec is <em>opposed</em> to the “National” government
 in Ottawa.)</p>
<p>In 1962, the Québec wing of the Social Credit
Party rose out of nowhere to become a major voting
bloc in the federal parliament: the Railiement
Créditiste. The deputy leader of the Quebec wing
was named Giles Grégoire, an intense ideological
type as compared to used-car salesman Réal Caouette,
In great danger of oversimplification, the Créditistes
are sort of a mixture of populism, Birch-style anti-establishment
 conservatism, anti-communism and anti-banker.
 Apart from their monetary theory (like
Milton Friedman?), they are hard-core free enterprise.
Certainly excellent material for conversion to libertarianism.</p>
<p>After the 1963 election, the RC split with the
national SC; and later Grégoire Split with Caouette—over
 the separatist issue. Single-handedly,
through an adroit use of parliamentary procedure,
Grégoire stopped the entire House of Commons from
doing anything about the Seaway Strike crisis. When
his patriotism was appealed to, he replied that he
owed nothing to Canada, which he did not even believe
 in. He left the House of Commons to start
his own Provincial Party, the Ralliement National
(I told you to watch for that word).</p>
<p>Then along came President Charles DeGaulle of
France to infuriate his Canadian hosts and delight
the nationalists. “Vive Le Québec Librel”, the
cry of the separatists, was heard around the world.
In the next election RN got 3% of the vote and RIN
6%.</p>
<p>In the Liberal provincial cabinet, René Levesque
heard his call. After leading a small splinter faction
 out of the Liberal Party (and helping the conservative-aligning
 Union National back into power
briefly), he formed a Movement for Sovereignty Assn.
to lobby for a separate Québec. Then, as an election
 approached in the early Seventies, he brought the
RIN and RN into a coalition and formed the Parti Québec.
To put it mildly, with Liberals, socialists and Créditistes,
 it was a “popular front.” The P.Q. scored
24% of the vote, though it won far less seats because
of the distribution of the vote, with Liberals, UN
and RC splitting the remainder.</p>
<p>This election Levesque played it cool, called
for reform measures and lower taxes, and even won
the support of the federalist editor of <em>Le Devoir</em>
(a sort of French-language TIMES) Claude Ryan. He
got 39% of the vote, and the federalists split the
rest. It was worth 68 out of 11O seats, and Levesque
 is now Premier of the province.</p>
<p>Trudeau first said it didn’t matter; then
the Prime Minister said he would oppose the Péquistes
taking Québec out of Confederation by any means he
found necessary. Meanwhile, Levesque is playing moderate,
 calling for a referendum in two or three years
on the question. Needless to say, those of us who do
not believe in political parties expect him to sell
out—but then there are the radicals who just might
not let him.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is known to Créditistes: in fact,
I have personally corresponded with a parliamentary
assistant of Réal Caouette (a friend from Alberta).
It could use a lot more exposure—especially to the
Ralliment National but also the more thoughtful Liberals
 and even the radical Leftists if it is presented
 in a sufficiently revolutionary fashion.</p>
<p>This is no island or coral reef in the middle of
nowhere we are talking about, but a province with a
population of over six million containing the most
cosmopolitan city in North America (eat your heart
out, New York). Yes, there is a Libertarian Party in
Québec, and of course it has made itself entirely irrelevant
 to the struggle there by attacking campus
radicals and mouthing Objectivist code phrases. Qui
est Jean Gait and who cares? <em>Ecrasez l’état</em> would
sell—but no one is marketing it.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, the seeds of secession
still planted in the South, New England, the Pacific
Northwest, California, and even New York City might
sprout given the successful example just across the
border. At the very least, libertarians can give
the separatists a chorus of approval and sell their
cause to sympathisers on this side of the line. Who
knows; it might even keep you out of a draftee uniform,
patrolling the streets of Trois Riviéres and dodging
sniper bullets à la Northern Ireland?</p>
