<h2>Agora v. Arena</h2>
<p>How does the world around you look to a hard-core libertarian?</p>
<p>Well, in general, it looks much like it does to everyone else... although
freedom’s advocates
 do fend to have a greater than their statistical share of quirkery and kookery. Libertarians
 are amused by comedy, saddened by tragedy, sweetened by candy, and soured by ill
fortune. Yes it is rumoured that when we are cut, we, too, bleed.</p>
<p>But there is one difference that we share with perhaps only the devoutly theological and
the Marxist. We have a comprehensive social structure. When we look at a newspaper story, we
integrate the facts into our social theory and draw conclusions. We see mighty and powerful
forces, and sweeps of history.</p>
<p>The well-read non-initiate sees facts around
him, but they are confusing and not of a piece.
They make only limited sense and are explained by
ad hoc theories read in yesterday’s column by some
pundit who has already forgotten how he interpreted
it.</p>
<p>An assassination? First reaction: how tragic!
Second reaction: how senseless of that person to
act that way. Third thought: he believed such and
such and therefore... or, he did not seem the type
to kill somebody, so the poor man must be insane!
It is here that the radical libertarian departs from
his fellow man... and not just because he does not
believe in insanity.</p>
<p>Perhaps the libertarian will end in agreement
that the act was private and motivated by whim of an
irrational man. But before that conclusion, he
will investigate other possibilities—possibilities
that the act <em>was</em> motivated by (perhaps not so enlightened,
 but nevertheless) self-interest.</p>
<p>He will ask: <em>cui bono?</em> Whose good?</p>
<p>Tariffs are not passed because of the great
belief of the masses in the “American system” or
“Economic Nationalism”—that is just the sales
pitch. The cotton tariff exists because the cotton
agricultural plutocrats financed the lobbying, bought
those who would be, and paid off editors to sling
propaganda and twisted workers to vote against those
who would oppose them. And make deals with other
plutocrats fighting for their interests who control
their bloc of legislators <em>et al.</em> The legislature of
the democratic country in question is then just
the playing field of the powerful interests.</p>
<p>They know the rules of the game and, if they
do not play by them, they get slapped down. The
gladiator may not step out of the ring and stab
Caesar. The political system is the arena of the
ruling class, the power elite, the Higher Circles,
the open “conspiracy” of a State. Political
parties and their factions are the tools, the
mock weapons, the counters on the game board for
the rich and powerful.</p>
<p>Preach populism and soak the rich? Fine,
turn it into the Populist Party and you have, say,
the silver interests sending a rook against a few
pawns of King Republican. Progressivism your bag?
Excellent, the transportation interests can get
“regulation” which will finally solve the troublesome
 problem of cartelization on a relatively free
market.</p>
<p>How about social democracy? Good, the industries
 of “peace” which were not getting their
“share” of the federal rip-off known as “taxes”
can now expand their markets of goods for the
needy’s “welfare.”</p>
<p>Surely Bolshevism, raw State communism, is
immune to plutocratic gain? Ask Pepsi-Cola, which
was just granted a monopoly over Coca-Cola in the
USSR in exchange for a monopoly of sales and distribution
 in Russian wines.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if you have just been brought to the
border of acceptance of this awful truth about
Statism, you recoil in horror at the cynical picture
 presented. Is there no hope, you ask? Can
not a Party of Libertarians escape the fate that
has overtaken every other, from Whig to Nazi?
(And if you believe that the National Socialists
were true to <em>their</em> campaign promises, ask an old
follower of Ernst Roehm or Gregor Strasser.)</p>
<p>Nope. No hope.</p>
<p>But why do we have to play the game in which
the other side has made the rules and has all the
pieces? There <em>is</em> another game whose only rules
are the laws of nature, whose rules we can deduce
from the study of science and praxeology. These
rules are not subject to whimsical legislation and
the clash of interests, whatever interpretation
you prefer.</p>
<p>The Market still works on the basis of supply
and demand. And always will. And anyone who can
get goods with relatively low cost (perhaps with
high risks if there is a lot of State intervention)
to one willing and able to pay a relatively high
price will still earn a profit. The worker usefully
 engaged in satisfying demanded production will
earn his wages—if he accepts the risk and takes
needed precautions against rip-offs. The investor
can still gain his interest by backing the aforementioned
 entrepreneur and labourer—if he hedges
against the State-caused inflation.</p>
<p>And those whose wealth arose and is maintained
in defiance of the State and is threatened by the
State’s existence will be moved by self-interest
to destroy his enemy—just as the plutocrat is
motivated to maintain the system.</p>
<p>Choose the arena over the agora if you will.
I intend to pick up my marbles and go home. And
have.</p>
