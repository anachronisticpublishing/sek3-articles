<h2>That Bread Is Mine, Too (2)</h2>
<p>In Part 1 of this article, Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist noted the inordinate
 difficulty that libertarian gurus have
had in defining that which is due the victim of
a crime. Without a simple and sure understanding
of justice, one is lost in deciding complex
questions like: “What are oppressed people due
after a revolution?”</p>
<p>YFNA pointed out that the fundamental libertarian
 axiom leads immediately to the corollary
that a person is entitled to the following: his
lost property or equivalent market value, cost
of apprehension of the Violence Initiator (VI) by
his protection agent, and the market interest
on the value lost for the time it was out of
his hands. Full restitution, but no more. Any
further imposition on the VI is violence initiated
 against <em>his</em> property.</p>
<p>One thing which confirms the propriety of
this position is its market practicality. It
is simple to define in any specific case what
is due a victim by simply consulting the market.</p>
<p>Here’s another serendipity. The longer
the VI eludes your trusty protection agent,
the higher is the cost of apprehension, and
the higher his restitution. But even if the
Insurance and Protection Company does nothing
until they are tipped off, he is still racking
up interest for the involuntary loan. So he
has a strong market incentive to turn himself
in and cut his losses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the VI resists by naked
violence an assault by p.a.’s (“You’ll never
take me alive, marketeer!”), his restitution
rises enormously. Now he owes restitution to
injured p.a.’s as well.</p>
<p>Probably the stickiest question of justice 
a has to face is: What of death?
Murder most foul, or even manslaughter. What
value is a human life?</p>
<p>Well, another human life is all YFNA can
come up with, being somewhat mortal himself.
But, more importantly, why not let the victim
decide it?</p>
<p>In your insurance policy, state what you
want. The execution of your murderer because
you believe in deterrence? OK. But what about
the father who rather have the VI support
his family? (This, by the way, is a basic
position of many tribal codes of justice.) And
what of the idealist who wants a foundation
financed to continue the work he was living
for?</p>
<p>After all, we believe in subjective value
theory, don’t we? To be consistent, then, we
must allow each potential victim (i.e., you) to
decide his own value—or whatever lesser quantity
he will be forced to settle for.</p>
<p>The answers to the questions YFNA posed at
the beginning of this essay are now clear. When
the State collapses, the Statists will be
brought to justice by those sufficiently motivated
 to do so. Claims will be handled by the
arbitration and protection agencies. They will
be decided on the simple premise of libertarian
justice: full restitution. The Higher Circles
will have such an enormous debt that they will
be stripped of their holdings, which will be
sold for restitution. Then they will be confined
 to restitution work camps for the rest of
their days, unless the market decides on an incentive
 system to increase their output by offering
 them eventual freedom. Lesser Statists
will have less claims against them and lose less
accordingly.</p>
<p>Pacifists naturally need enter no claim if
they wish their oppressors to get off. Native
inhabitants who can present a reasonable claim
for land stolen from their ancestors can regain
their property. Peasants who had their land
confiscated by the State can regain it—a truly
meaningful and just “land reform program.”</p>
<p>As usual, libertarianism has the answers
for those who apply their God-given or Rand-inspired
 reason to the questions. And if they
ask for their money back, they will get it to
the penny—er, gold milligram, that is.</p>
<p>Everyone can get what’s coming to her—but
 only the libertarian way. If someone tries
to sell you another way, look out for his free
lunch and hold on to your wallet.</p>
