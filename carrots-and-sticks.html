            <h4>Samuel E. Konkin, 3rd</h4>
<h2>Carrots And Sticks</h2>
<p>Reading over past columns for SLR, Your
Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist notices
that they have been uniformly negative. Now
YFNA is not at all that sort of person who is
gnawed upon by a general hatred. So let the
brickbats flit out of this dark corner, carrying
the corpses of the deviationists they struck,
and let a few kudos be distributed.</p>
<p>Since SLR is East-Coast-oriented, let me
start by bringing to your attention some Western
libertarians who have been all-too-neglected.
Robert M. LeFevre, for example, shines in the
anarchofirmament with Murray Rothbard, but not,
alas, with the same magnitude in this longitude.
LeFevre has an excellent journal (LEFEVRE’S
JOURNAL, of course) which is free of both deviationism
 and big words like “deviationism.”</p>
<p>It could be passed on to your reactionary parents
and read with enjoyment by them, but gives a
thrill to this wild-eyed bombthrower as well.
The only thing I disagree with the estimable
grand old man of Western libertarianism on is
his pacifism, which, when compared to the Partyphilia
 of some other mentors of our Movement, is
like comparing a cold to cancer. And if your
libertarianism is objectivist-based, watch it.
He will mess with your mind without you even
noticing before it’s too late and you may be
too far gone! (LJ, Box 2353, Orange, Calif.
92669, contribution of $10 suggested)</p>
<p>Even-handed Lloyd Licher could be credited
with single-handedly keeping the Calif. libertarians
 in alliance since the Browning out of the
great Dana Rohrabacher. Lloyd runs the Libertarian
 Supper Club of Los Angeles; and every month,
the Movement gathers at the Taix Restaurant to
recharge their intellectual batteries with another
 speaker (and fill their anarchobellies
while they are at it). If you want to meet a
lot of libertarians in L.A. quick when you visit
or move there, write ahead of time to Lloyd and
send a couple of bucks so he can mail you his
newsletter and let you know when next they gather
well in advance. (Libtn. Sup. Club of L.A. Newse
letter, Lloyd Licher, 12536 Woodbine St., L.A.,
Calif. 90066, $1.50/year until the postal rates
go up again)</p>
<p>Dare I forget John Yench? John 15 a reporter
 for the ANAHEIM BULLETIN, a mild-mannered to
boot. Ah, but when he slips into a telephone
booth, out comes...another Free Enterprise Forum
(libertarian conference, to which he kindly invited
 me last year, to speak, etc.) and maybe
another issue of CHRISTIAN LAISSEZ FAIRE! What?
“Christian”? Yes, and hard-core anarchoagorist,
too. Did he ever check his premises, you ask?
Yes, and he found a big cross over them every
Sunday. I find John indispensible as a contact
with a whole body of people outside the decadent,
unbelieving East and a healthy antidote to the
Conservative Christian quasilibertarian Foundation
for Economic Education. (CHRISTIAN LAISSEZ FAIRE,
Box 772, Anaheim, Calif. 92805. About $2 per
year, last I heard)</p>
<p>Seymour (Sy) Leon is a hard-core activist
who is also a real live entrepreneur. Sy has
taken LeFevre’s old Rampart College and turned
it into a profit-making Operation. He has been
advance man for Harry Browne, spreading the message
 to those on whom it will do the most good.
He is the instigator and chief honcho of the
League of Non-Voters and has received publicity
for the Libertarian Movement with next-to-no-investment
 and no vote-chasing that the Partyarchs
 would eat their hearts out for. He has so
integrated theory and practice (or should I say
preaching and profit) to make me eat my <em>heart</em>
out. (Seymour Leon, Box 11407, Santa Ana, Calif.
92711)</p>
<p>Christopher Bates is somebody I just had to
like. He got YFNA to autograph every copy of
NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES he had in his collection.
Chris is also from the Commonwealth (Britain in
his case), and a fan. Of perhaps more import to
the reader, Chris was in the thick of the San
Diego Ten (or eleven, I lost count) Tax Rebellion
Case. And he won. And he could be deported at
any time (like me, for example) without trial
or any other of those statist’s lulls of security.
Chris is like a lot of other “immigrants” I know,
who had this dream of finding a land full of
heroes and Good Guys and, when they found them
scarce, became them to fulfill their dreams.</p>
<p>Although gone the way of all-too-many anarchomarriages,
 that of Sy and Riqui Leon has been
the biggest boon to the Calif. Movement for several
 years. Riqui was the Dolly Madison of the
Movement, throwing parties every so often at their
Orange County house. Recently she has been prominent
 in defending Women’s Lib from a libertarian
perspective against Arch-Chauvinists such as Murray
 Rothbard. Riqui has also played den mother
to many a libertarian growing up a bit slow.</p>
<p>Before I leave Southern Calif., let me not
slight anyone, but simply affirm that there are
many libertarians I know well enough to exalt but
who have not the general fame for their less persistent
 endeavors (generally due to working for a
living, an affliction found rarely on the E. Coast).
And there are others of fame that do not enjoy my
personal knowledge, such as Joe Galambos, Natallee
Hall and Skye D’Aureous, El Rayo and Naomi Gatherer,
 and Lou Rollins, whose good and worthy efforts
will someday earn them a more adept chronicler.</p>
<p>Let us move up the Coast to the neglected
Northwest and stop briefly in Oregon. In Portland
 you will be utterly unable to find, since he
is a confirmed recluse, someone of libertarian
bent who cares little enough for “The Movement”
*bow, scrape*. In fact, he is the fellow who
taught me to write in asterisks like this *praise,
praise* and set a revolution in style and literature
 throughout Science Fiction fandom with his
SCIENCE FICTION REVIEW. Richard E. Geis is passing
through his middle age, but remains young of heart
and Spry of brain, and will probably unfailingly
put out some sort of fanzine that will make me drop
all my activities and labours when perusing my
mailbox and finding him. And have me seek some
nice corner complete with couch to curl up and
read. So his reviews are infallible in telling
you who to read and who not to, though granted,
only for form and style. But if Dick is cavalier
towards content, his unflinching eye will observe
for you who’s saying it well for us and them, and
who is botching it. And as his famous “Alter Ego”
revealed in WORLDS OF IF, he is a lover of “Romantic”
 fiction, that which is written for <em>you</em>
and not for the literary critic and his set.
(SCIENCE FICTION REVIEW, P.0. Box 11408, Portland,
 Ore. 97211. $4/year)</p>
<p>Still further north, in the Washington area,
we find lurking one Joseph Michael Sharp, Mike to
his anarcho-friends. Besides trying to get Libertarian
 Alliances going on Washington campuses, and
keeping campus papers hopping with columns, Mike
tried lighting torches for Ludwig von Mises, even
putting out an issue or two or WERTFREI, a journal
of praxeology. When last heard from, Mike was
Browning, but I assume not for long. He is being
persuaded to grace the pages of NLN with reports
from that Dark Area of our communications, and
perhaps he will be seen in SLR.</p>
<p>Before we leave the West Coast, let us not
forget to cast an aloha over the waves. Although
the PACIFIC LIBERTARIAN is gone, Jerrold D. Dickson
 and his FREE has the Movement in Hawaii relatively
 pure and lively. Jerry is also a fan, and
is building a libertarian alliance of some sort,
not scorning our New Libertarians. Hawaii has
always been a hotbed of activism, with a libertarian
 radio station being driven off the air
and libertarians being busted in a Census Resistance
 case, the only such bust from the great Census
 Resistence organized by SIL in 1970. I’m
sure it’s a great comfort to Jerry that I expect
him to follow in their footsteps, but perhaps he
will tread with greater care. (FREE, Box 2776,
Honolulu, Haw. 96803. $5/yr.)</p>
<p>So, says the faithful reader, the West
Coast and the East Coast are filled with the
great and the good. What a pity that the Middle
of the Continent has such a dearth of wise and
true! Hah, replies YFNA. Just wait until the
next issue.</p>
