            <h2>This Movement of His: Murray N. Rothbard, 1926–1995</h2>
<h4>By Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<p>In person, Murray Rothbard could be described as a Woody Allen who
had studied economics; it was no accident that one of his all-time favourite
directors was Mel Brooks. When confronted with accusations that former
conservatives had become so ideological as libertarians that they were
turning into humorless movement cogs, one had only to offer in rebuttal
the contrast of Murray with Marx, Lenin, and, for that matter, Rand. Even
the Conservative who purged him from <em>National Review</em> in the 1950s for
high deviations (refusal to sanction the State for anti-Communist crusading),
 William F. Buckley, had to refer to his victims as “Murray Rothbard
and his Merry Band of Anarchists.”</p>
<p>This personality stability and good humor have profound consequences
for what he, oft described as the Godfather of the modern Libertarian
Movement, called “This Movement of Ours.” First and foremost, it meant
that no matter how much one disagreed with him, one was not cast into
outer darkness (again, unlike Marx, Lenin, and Rand) never to be mentioned
 again. In 1977, at our most estranged over the Libertarian Party, I
described him as Darth Vader in print. Three years later he was purged
from the mighty Kochtopus by the device of taking away his token shares
in the Cato Institute, which evoked his loudest cries of betrayal. I promptly
sent him shares in <em>New Libertarian</em> magazine with the caveat that they
could not be taken away from him under any circumstances. He responded
 immediately with customary wit.</p>
<p>Rothbard’s impact on libertarian (and agorist) intellectual and ideological
 development will easily fill our entire next number of <em>AQ;</em> personal
tributes and discussion of his movement impact and the Post-Rothbard
future, if any, of the Libertarian Movement will take up at least one, if not
more, issues of <em>NL.</em></p>
<p>Two points need to be made immediately: there would be no Libertarian
Movement save for the thought and action (particularly in the 1960s) of
Professor Murray Newton Rothbard, Ph.D., and, had he pursued the same
sort of tactics he had experienced in his association with fellow students at
Columbia, or with the Randists or the ex-Communist purgers around
Buckley, the Movement that we know today would not have endured.</p>
<p>As one who finds himself more and more belonging to another, different
 movement of the future, I offer to all Movements, present and future,
the example of one who disdained to retain his leadership by any means
save superiority in intellectual combat and possession of sharper wit. I
hope that the world shall see many more of his like.</p>
