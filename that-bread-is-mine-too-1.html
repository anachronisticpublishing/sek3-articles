<h2>That Bread Is Mine, Too (1)</h2>
<p>Okay, so the State was smashed yesterday
 morning. Now what?</p>
<p>Obviously, everybody will go his/her
own way and make oodles of gold. Some of it
will be spent on protection agents and arbitration.
 And we shall be ever-vigilant
against the return of the State!</p>
<p>But what are we going to do if someone
wants his money back?</p>
<p>Such a question is far from academic,
for one’s view of justice seems to determine
one’s revolutionary tactics. Robert LeFevre,
 the anarcho-pacifist, pursues a
purely educational route because he has
foresworn the use of defensive restitutive
force. What else can he do? Murray Rothbard,
 enamored with “temporary” political
expedients, pursues popular fronts with
rightists, then leftists, then partyarchs.
With his “double restitution” or “restitution
 plus punishment” theory, he finds himself
 allied with the Penal Institution
crowd regardless of other alliances.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand seeks unlimited restitution,
and since infinity can only be achieved
mystically she must resurrect a government—and
 does. John Hospers once wrote
an article for REASON criticizing all libertarian
 theories of justice and choosing
the “lesser evil.” Needless to say, his
strategy operates the same way. It’s called
politics.</p>
<p>Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist
 assumes he has made his point.
But he remains bewildered at the confusion.
It seems to him that libertarian justice
is blindingly obvious.</p>
<p>So before he troubles you with the
obvious, let YFNA justify taking up your
time once more. What if somebody wants her
money back?</p>
<p>What if someone walks up to you and
says, “David Rockefeller has taken a million
 dollars from me through the State’s
intervention and I can prove it! What
should I, the brand-new libertarian, do?”</p>
<p>What will be your answer? Will it be
the same to an Indian seeking relief from
centuries of white-eye long-knife rip-off?
How about Mexican peasants and Bircher suburbanites?</p>
<p>OK, you are properly motivated. Let’s
start out with that fine old libertarian
mainstay, the <em>a priori</em> axiom. Remember that
libertarians believe that everyone has an
absolute right to life and property. Fine.
Now Blue Meanie snatches your stereo system
 and a complete set of Beatles’ records.
You discover Mr. M in rapture on his living
room floor. You and your trusty protection
agent have followed the sound of blaring
speakers and you confront him. Old Blue
calls his p.a. and it’s off to arbitration.</p>
<p>Here come the arbitrator! And he quickly
ascertains B.M.’s guilt. To what are you
entitled?</p>
<p>The answer, as I have said, is blindingly
obvious. Your property! After all, isn’t
<em>that</em> what you have the absolute right to?
As a libertarian, how can you disagree? Of
course, if you believe that it has become
the thief’s property by his foul act (a la
LeFevre) you would have given up and not
wasted your time on restitution anyway. But
otherwise, you are clearly entitled to that
which was yours—which <em>is</em> yours, come hell,
high water, or a plague of statists, if
you are a hard-core, property-loving libertarian.</p>
<p>Now let’s spell it out. You are entitled
 to the stereo system and record collection.
 Anything else? Well, you’ve got
to move it back, so Blue Meanie either hauls
it back under the p.a.’s watchful eye or pays
to have it done. What about the p.a. and
Arbitrator Fineguy? Again, their fee should
be paid by the miscreant who incurred the
cost.</p>
<p>So you have your stereo system and
records back, and a record was scratched!
Blue pays for replacement at market value.
It took a day to capture him. All right,
charge him 1/365th of the market rate of
interest (for you) that it would have cost
to have borrowed the money to replace your
machine and your collection.</p>
<p>Now mix in a highly competent Insurance
and Protection Agency. Upon notification
of the Violence Initiation against you, they
verify it and promptly replace your loss.
They then pursue and capture the villain,
prove him guilty, and get their cost and the
cost of your loss out of him. If he can’t
pay—or won’t tell where his loot’s buried—there’s
 always the restitution work camps.</p>
<p>Smooth, efficient, moral—the mark of
the free market.</p>
<p>But should more be extracted from the
Blue Meanie? Punish him and teach the dastardly
 villain a lesson!</p>
<p>Well, no. First of all, full restitution
 (property replacement plus apprehension
 cost plus interest for time loss)
of what’s yours is all you are entitled to.
To get more is to take away from another.
TANSTAAFL.</p>
<p>And if you use force, that’s theft.
On <em>your</em> part. Hence, by a simple application
 of the fundamental libertarian axiom
we have defined both the minimum you are
entitled to—and the maximum as well. And
lo and behold, they coincide. No broad area
to approximate in, no confusion or fuzziness.
 A sharp, clear, unique answer. For
you unregenerate neo-objectivists, A is A.
You are entitled to that to which you are
entitled. For anarcho-Austrians, it’s
wonderfully praxeological. It’s true and
it works.</p>
<p>Now what do we do with it?</p>

 Restitution Theory)</p>
