<h2>Anarchozionism</h2>
<p>So now it’s Abaco.</p>
<p>From the earliest days of Ayn Rand’s influence
 over the Libertarian Movement, frustrated
activists have given up on their efforts to reform
 or revolt against the American State to seek
the promised Gulch.</p>
<p>In the early 1960’s, a group composed primarily
 of engineers and technologists worked on
a plan to construct an island nation on a shallow
land base of the North Sea. Preform agreed on a
tiny, nominal government, a free port status which
would thrive on free trade between Britain, Norway,
and Denmark. Individuals who had been into education
 and political action (the LIBERAL INNOVATOR,
leafletting the Cow Palace GOP convention) gave up
and published PREFORM-INFORM backing the escapees.</p>
<p>Then the British seized the pirate radio stations
 operating outside their territorial waters.
Oil was discovered in the North Sea, and Britain,
Denmark, and Norway promptly carved up the sea
bed. The Preform crowd either Browned out or
went into escapist trips such as becoming nomads,
troglodytes, or wilderness dwellers. They sought
“invulnerability to coercion”—or vonu—and
PREFORM-INFORM became Vonulife. Recently it
sputtered to a halt, and the paranoia freaks
drifted back to civilization.</p>
<h3>Operation Atlantis</h3>
<p>Then came Operation Atlantis. Again the
anarchist ocean bed was the site, and a platform-island
 was to be constructed in the Caribbean. A
group gathered in Saguerties, N.Y., took over a
motel, and built a boat. Again they published a
newsletter, and started a commodities operation
(real goods bank) called ATCOPS which took silver
deposits. They even began their own money system,
the Deca (10 grams of silver).</p>
<p>The boat sank, and prospective sites were
nationalized, but they still are plugging away in
Saguerties.</p>
<p>Then came Michael Oliver and his New Country
project, which eventually decided on a Pacific
coral reef named Minerva. Perhaps the goddess of
wisdom drove the men involved mad for their hubris.
As soon as concrete plans were formed, Oliver
split with the rest. A hardy individualist who
actually went to the reef to photograph it and
lay claim by homesteading was burned by organizers
 when he returned, and the ship that arrived
in N.Y. to carry a load of anarcho-immigrants never
sailed. It just sat in dock and leaked. The comical
 King of Tonga then laid claim to Minerva and
was supported by the less funny states of Fiji and
Indonesia.</p>
<p>Now it appears that the Bahamian secessionists
 of Abaco are interested in American backing
and are even willing to listen politely to John
Hospers. But their aims are to set up a state of
their own. The Bahamian state has deported Hospers
as a dangerous Subversive and seem ready to act
to keep their citizenry enshackled.</p>
<h3>Can It Work?</h3>
<p>The villain in all these plays has been the
State—always ready to move against the opening of
a free society anywhere. But sometimes, dear Brutus,
 we must not look to the stars but to ourselves.
 Why hasn’t the State’s intervention been
assumed from the beginning? After all, these were
libertarians leading and organizing these plans.
Was it not the very frustration with the State’s
omnipresence that lead them to desperate measures?
Why should they believe that the very institution
willing to follow them home, into their pockets
and bedrooms, would suddenly go “hands-off” because
 they crossed some imaginary line on a globe?</p>
<p>Ayn Rand’s shrugging Atlases at least faced
a crumbling state, one which was becoming too
weak and incompetent to find and destroy their
embryonic free society. It is self-consistently
obvious that if those who make the statist society
 work abandon it and devote their efforts
to a free society, the State will fall and the
free area will function.</p>
<p>But without these people and conditions? A
is A, but suppose you don’t have A? Ayn herself
has never backed a single new country group, to
her credit. My conclusion is that if the promised
 land seekers continue to pursue their Zion
despite a dismal record in practice due to demonstrated
 errors in theory, they don’t need
Rand, Rothbard, or, for that matter, Konkin or
Royce. Szasz and Branden may offer more concrete
assistance.</p>
<p>As for me, anarchy begins at home.</p>
