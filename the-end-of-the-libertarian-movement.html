            <h2>The End of the Libertarian Movement</h2>
<h4>by Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<p>The end of the libertarian movement
  is a libertarian society. Where 
else does a movement move but to its 
goal?</p>
<p>It must follow, therefore, that if a 
libertarian society has formed, the 
libertarian movement has reached its 
end. It has.</p>
<p>This article is the beginning of a 
series the author plans to distribute to 
various publications—in various appropriate
  styles—of the libertarian 
movement concerning the direction of 
that body of people and thought for 
the next phase of its maturity. Underpinning
  the series lie the assumptions:</p>
<p>The new libertarian society is present; 
the new libertarian society must be 
fully self-conscious for both its full 
utilization and enjoyment and its self-preservation
  and growth, and the new
libertarian society is a good goal, 
worthy of getting and keeping.</p>
<p>All these assumptions need verification;
  none are presently held by 
libertarians, with the exception of the 
last. However, if the first two are 
accepted, the third requires re-evaluation.
  Why? One is no longer talking 
about a quasi-utopian ideal “out there” 
which is <em>defined</em> as good, but rather a 
real entity which is now open to 
examination and observation as to 
whether it is indeed good.</p>
<p>The next article in the series will be 
primarily concerned with the enacting 
of the second assumption, the raising 
of the libertarian consciousness concerning
  their own society. It will do so 
by empirically demonstrating the first 
premise.</p>
<p>Subsequent elucidations and answers
  to challenges will complete the 
fulfillment of this second premise. 
Once the main body of libertarians 
accept those two premises in whole or 
part, the third one will become open 
to debate: “What hath we wrought?”</p>
<p>This article is a glimpse of the 
future of this thesis—where will it lead 
if and when it is verified. It is written 
for a select audience of avant-garde, 
highly “movement-conscious” libertarians
  who should grasp the arguments 
readily. Thus, when the position is 
presented, orderly, sequentially, and 
painstakingly to the general populace 
of libertarians, it will already be anticipated
  by our readers and they will be 
ready for its tactical deployment.</p>
<p>If one hears the hint of the strategic 
in this, one hears well.</p>
<h3>The Growth of Libertarian Consciousness</h3>
<p>The earliest, most primitive libertarians
  had an excellent consciousness.
  Josiah Warren attempted to 
create a separate anarchist community,
  to both show the world how well 
anarchy worked and to enjoy the 
benefits of living in the superior 
society. Because of the faulty economics
  of the early individualists, it was 
not sufficiently an improvement over 
the external society and remained 
unviable.</p>
<p>Lysander Spooner supported secession
  to bring about libertarian societies—the
  secession of black slaves 
from white owners, southern whites 
from northern whites, and western 
silver-coining society from eastern 
gold-dominant bimetallists. Since all 
these moves were crushed, one will 
not know if viable communities could 
have seceded. But it is significant that 
Spooner himself did not secede.</p>
<p>Benjamin fucker abandoned 
thoughts of living his egoistic anarchist
  values over a period of time, 
becoming a gadfly social critic of the 
external society, and finally giving up 
in despair and exiling himself in 
France. And with that act, libertarianism
  went into its Dark Ages.</p>
<p>No accident is it that Ayn Rand revived 
 libertarian morale by creating—at
  least on paper—a viable libertarian 
community in Galt’s Gulch. Of course 
Mises had to work out the economics, 
Nock and Chodorov had to keep the 
anarcho-individualist insights alive 
(though with deep cynicism) for Rand 
to re-synthesize. But Rand wrote a 
blueprint, made sympathisers think it 
could really work, and recruitment 
shot up.</p>
<p>Even before the 1969 split from the 
Right, libertarians attempted to live 
their ideas. One of the most ambitious
projects was Preform—an attempt to 
build a Galt’s Gulch on an artificial
island in the North Sea. Confiscation 
of the ocean bed by the surrounding 
states broke up that group, with the 
hard core attempting to find their 
retreat within the U.S.—but in remote 
areas (Vonulife). With no viable market
  and isolation of the vonuers from 
even the libertarian community, they 
self-destructed.</p>
<p>Anarchozionist searches for the 
promised Gulch continue to attract 
hopeful libertarians to coral reefs and 
Caribbean gambling dens. Since basic 
new libertarian principles of market 
are ignored by these projects, they 
fail.</p>
<p>What happened in 1969 added the 
needed ingredient to make the libertarian
  society possible in the here and 
now. And it was provided, ironically, 
by those who are most often accused 
of escapist fantasizing.</p>
<h3>The Separation of Libertarian Culture</h3>
<p>In 1969, at the time of the St. Louis 
split, a culture without economics or 
political philosophy met an economic-political 
  movement without a culture 
or societal consciousness. At the same 
city on the same weekend, the Young 
Americans for Freedom Convention 
and the World Science Fiction Convention
  occurred—with considerable 
crossing by delegates back and forth.</p>
<p>Thus, the Libertarian Caucus called 
their bulletin TANSTAAFL and described
  the traditionalist-dominated 
National Office as “a bad Wizard.” It 
was less the introduction of SF as of 
<em>fannishness</em> that gave the libertarians a 
rudimentary self-consciousness and 
cohesiveness. And this self-aware 
grouping split amoeba-like, to form its 
own “movement.”</p>
<p>Once a young neophyte plunged 
into the Libertarian Movement, he or 
she found that there were progressive 
stages to go through. One read libertarian
  SF and objectivist novels, listened
  to lectures or tapes of them, 
picked up history of the movement 
and found out who the Big Names 
were, and joined or quit groups, clubs, 
organizations, and social gatherings.</p>
<p>All of this is a direct parallel with SF 
fandom. And the more one “got into” 
the Movement, the more alienated 
one would feel with external society. 
Finally, pressure built up for highly 
committed libertarians to choose—become
  full-time libertarians or return
  to some form of assimilation with 
external society. The first choice led to 
agorism, the second to politics, and 
the inability to choose—the tension of 
seeing no alternative—led to the 
Brown-outs.</p>
<p>These phenomena deserve — and 
will receive—a separate writing. We 
are, as I have said, looking ahead to 
the consequences of the analysis, not 
the analysis itself. What is needed yet 
to deduce the conclusion is to define 
what we’re talking about.</p>
<h3>The Meaning of Libertarian Movement</h3>
<p>Many libertarians reject the very 
idea of being grouped in a collective. 
Some perfectly consistent, hard-core 
libertarians reject even the label libertarian
  because of the fear of being 
associated with others with whom they 
have small differences.</p>
<p>Of course they can choose to be 
hermits and they can deny all their 
ideas so they cannot be labelled 
(except as “anti-idea”—there’s no escape
  from labels short of destroying 
language).</p>
<p>On the other hand, few libertarians 
would flinch at being ( ailed “members 
of society.” And society is recognized 
as a plural concept in modern times: 
American society, Soviet Society, etc. 
One talks of Jewish society within 
European society, or Parsee society 
within Indian society, and so forth. 
What defines a society requires much 
more space, so it wall be left to subsequent
  articles. Suffice it here to say it 
implies similar cultural and philosophical
  ideas (not necessarily ethnic), 
and above all, the <em>consciousness</em> of the 
societal individuals that they belong.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s tackle the 
concept of “movement.” All “movements”
  have a goal—to transform the 
society they live in. When they have 
done so, it will be a <em>new</em> society. Most 
movements explicitly assert this.</p>
<p>Libertarians are unique in that they 
will not attempt to compel a <em>complete</em> 
change in the society they are in. They 
will leave some alone who freely (and 
perversely) choose to reject membership
  in the libertarian society. This 
then, is the big step in my logic. A 
libertarian society, except by the most 
improbably accident, will co-exist with 
non-libertarian societies.</p>
<p>But hold—if that is true, where do 
we draw the line? <em>How many people must 
the Libertarian Movement reach to create 
the Libertarian Society?</em> 10,000? 100,000? 
A million? A hundred million?</p>
<p>The Parsees number around a hundred
  thousand; the largest coherent 
society (not counting overlordship 
over smaller societies) in the Soviet 
Union is less than a hundred million. 
By those limits, the libertarian movement
  has already passed the lower 
limit!</p>
<p>But if the Libertarian Movement 
has created a Libertarian Society, then 
it has succeeded. It has reached its 
end. It is . . .finished.</p>
<h3>The End of the Libertarian Movement</h3>
<p>The implications of the above 
sketchy analysis begin to hit home. 
The final task of the libertarian 
movement is to complete the consciousness-raising
  of those identifying 
themselves as libertarians into thinking
  of themselves as a separate, real-live
  society.</p>
<p>Rather, that’s the penultimate task. 
For when that task is accomplished, 
the Libertarian Movement’s <em>own</em> consciousness
  wall be raised and it will 
have to destroy whatever vested interests,
  encrusted institutions, and misplaced
  faith that it has acquired and—and 
  it must destroy itself.</p>
<p>The logic is inescapable, though 
surprising. The reader is invited to 
re-read this article and trace the steps, 
and begin the debate on the premises. 
As promised, further articles will be 
forthcoming in Movement magazines
