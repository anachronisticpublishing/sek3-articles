            <h4>SAMUEL E. KONKIN 3rd</h4>
<h2>Libertarian Strategy (1)</h2>
<p>In six years the Libertarian Movement has
learned a lot of lessons. While libertarian
theory continues to evolve and grow, the basic
ideology of 1969 remains valid. In fact, libertarian
 theory has reacted to the stimulation of
the swings and jolts from conflicting strategies.</p>
<p>So that we are not condemned to relive it,
let’s review our history. As of December, 1968,
libertarian strategy was directed either toward
influence of the conservatives or conversion of
the independents. It was wholly educational or
retreatist. Robert LeFevre’s Rampart College,
Leonard Read’s FEE, Joe Galambos’ FEI, Nathaniel
Branden’s NBI, F. A. Harper’s IHS, and Frank Chodorov’s
 ISI were all educational institutes. The
VonuLifers, Atlantis group, and Oliverites were
seeking escape. Except for the LIBERAL INNOVATOR’s
 leafletting of the Cow Palace in 1964, no
libertarians were involved in a political campaign
 except as deviationist individuals. Many
supported Nixon in 1968, but they were clearly
of conservative leanings.</p>
<p>The very victory of Nixon and sell-out of libertarian-conservative
 modest goals soured these
“campaigning individualists.” The rise of activist
 organizing as an alternative to political
campaigning and the seeming possibility of New
Left revolution attracted the campaigners to a
plausible alternative. Libertarians organized a
caucus within YAF with results we all know. In
December 1968, Rothbard and his small group of
radical libertarians—Block, Tuccille, Childs.
et al.—moved to bring libertarianism into SDS
and the New Left. The Radical Libertarian Alliance
was formed.</p>
<p>In 1969 the right-coalition tactic exploded
in St. Louis. But within a month the New Left-alliance
 tactic also shattered in New York. To
both the Libertarian Caucus and RLA leaders’ surprise,
 the result was the formation Of independent
 Libertarian Alliances across the country,
with the RLA and SIL central organizations becoming
 just “tendencies.” SIL adapted, becoming
a clearing house to the more scattered locals.
RLA turned briefly from a revolutionary group to
a political campaign group in late 1971, and
the Citizens for a Restructured Republic promptly
died on the campaign trail of 1972.</p>
<p>Graduation from universities began to decay
the campus-based libertarian alliances from 1970-72,
 and the LA’s began to replant themselves in
the straight communities. Eventually they would
exhibit themselves as Supper Clubs. Libertarian
Churches, or just meetings (e.g.: Gary Greenberg’s
NYLA). These were sound roots being set, but
hardly the spectacular, “shake-the-world” activities
 of the 1969-71 period.</p>
<p>More escapism offered itself (Minerva, Abaco)
and the educators kept educating. Many libertarians
 pursued more valuable long-range activities,
combining their business or professional careers
 with libertarian advocacy: running businesses
 on agoric bases, pursuing journalism,
academic research, and even television and
radio (Lowell Ponte, Ron Kimberling).</p>
<p>Many libertarians also turned inward with
incessant psychology sessions and in-group
self-criticism. This was the Movement as reflected
 in 1972 in, say, NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES,
and which could be pieced together from RAP,
LIBERTARIAN FORUM, REASON, ACADEMIC ASSOCIATES
LETTER, VONULIFE, FREEMAN, SIL NEWS, PACIFIC
LIBERTARIAN, and many local newsletters.</p>
<p>But in December of 1971, the political
campaign heresy arose again. To put it mildly,
Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist
was hardly an impartial observer of this weed
in our garden. But even then it seemed Obvious
to me from where it drew its appeal. First,
the need for a public “mass movement” visibility
 of many libertarians who were otherwise
quite sound on doctrine. And, second, there
were a lot of newcomers who had not “learned
their lesson” in 1968 and were confused enough
to believe that freedom can be imposed, i.e.,
“voted in.”</p>
<p>The Libertarian Party should have collapsed
as fast as the CRR, since its popular vote was
so far below the number of eligible libertarians
as to show its rejection and then some.</p>
<p>While it was obvious in N.Y. and Calif.,
the libertarians in the rest of the country
were too scattered to realize their true
strength (about 100,000, according to the lists
of the time, with less than 10,000 voting for
Hospers). Also, the electoral fast shuffle of
Roger MacBride diverted attention from the
overwhelming rejection of the LP.</p>
<p>Other libertarians campaigned for Nixon
(believe it or not), McGovern, Schmitz, and
Spock; and I have even heard of one or two who
voted for Linda Jenness (Trotskyite). Most libertarians
 didn’t vote, and Sy Leon’s League
of Non-Voters got excellent coverage on and off.</p>
<p>1973 was the year of the LP. The most
viable Opposition seemed to be a radical faction
<em>within</em> the LP, though again this was misleading.
The radical caucus (RC) was firmly rooted in
the anti-political libertarian tradition, and
nurtured by all the Movement outside the Party—from
 LeFevrians to Brownians, and even a token
Galombosian!</p>
<p>As soon as a real live political campaign
occurred in 1973, disillusionment began and the
rc’s ranks began to swell. Many partyites
simply dropped out immediately. The re broke
away at the state and national LP conventions
of 1974. By Spring of 1975 only the smallest
state parties on the E. Coast had not suffered
a large split, some “splits” involving nearly
the entire party. Significantly, those who
bolted were often the top activists, newsletter
editors, and theoreticians.</p>
<p>The long, painstaking construction of
a free society via a Counter-Economy cannot
be short-cut then. But, it may yet be argued,
 is there no way to harness this deep-seated
 drive to campaign publicly, and to
draw in the new recruits that the Goldwater/YAF
 and McGovern campaigns did? Is there no
such thing as a “pure” campaign which can get
all the benefits of the LP electioneering,
but avoid the deadly problems of monopoly organization,
 power-tripping, and, ultimately,
being Judas Goat for the State?</p>
<p>Obviously, there is Nobody we could run.</p>
