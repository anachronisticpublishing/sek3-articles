            <h2>To the Editor</h2>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I would like to forward to your readers some information I have concerning the
organizations you mention in your TAX RESISTANCE issue of the <em>Southern Libertarian
Messenger,</em> also known as the February, 1973 issue, alias Vol. I, No. 10. A fine
publication, by the way, worthy of the Libertarian Regional Press.</p>
<p>Andy Thornton, the current National Office of SLAM, is working at the Laissez
Faire Book Store because he was purged from War Tax Resisters for agorist deviationism.
 I do not believe in that crap about withdrawing sanction from every business
 which happens to be run by immoral people, i.e., those with differing political-ethical
 views, but I would think it appropriate that any libertarians dealing
with WTR indicate in their communications their agorist persuasion and take any
opportunity possible for berating WTR for their left bias.</p>
<p>Not all your readers are old Rightists, like us, David. (Maybe I Just speak
for myself?) You should explain to them when mentioning <em>The American Mercury</em> that
it is the flagship publication of Willis Carto’s Fraudulent Empire of Hate. Carto
is a Yockeyist, the author of the <em>Introduction to Imperium.</em> However, even the Nazis
 are abandoning him because of the fact that he runs his <em>American Mercury/Washington
 Observer</em>-etc. as a shill, constantly soliciting funds from the aspiring-intellectual
 bigots for actions and projects which either never take off or are far
below expectations. I was highly amused by that large ad the <em>New Banner</em> gave the
<em>Mercury.</em> Those ex-objectivists never did get to know the Right, and they are paying
 for their Rand-imposed ignorance.</p>
<p>You also might mention that the Student Libertarian Action Movement and the
Free Libertarian Party radical caucus, with hoped-for assists from the New York
Libertarian Association and the Society for Individual Liberty, will be in Libertarian
 Alliance for the Demonstration TAX IS THEFT, April 14 at 10AM, at 120
Church Street, Manhattan (the IRS Centre). Any freedom-symps among your readers
who happen to be around then, and want to get into Libertarian Action, are welcome.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to smash the state. You forgot yesterday, and, sure enough,
it’s still here.</p>
<p>—Samuel Edward Konkin<br />

<p><em>The Editor Replies:</em>
Thanks for setting-us straight, Sam. Some additional information has come
to light since we went to press last month. The Tax Rebellion Committee (1843
E. Balmont, Fresno, CA 93701) distributes some material on resisting and abolishing
 the income tax, and Henry Hohenstein (Suite 3K, 2530 (Continued on page 6)
