<h2>Corporativism Revivus</h2>
<p>What do Rollerball and Network,
the Seven Sisters and Rupert Murdoch,
Ayn Rand, Robert LeFevre, Sy Leon and
<em>Libertarian Connection</em> have in common?
All are indicators of a malaise in the
present libertarian movement which
could very well save the State.</p>
<p>Five years ago, at the tail end of the
old Rothbardianism, the libertarian
movement was overwhelmed by anti-corporation
 revisionism. Gabriel Kolko, for
his <em>Triumph of Conservatism,</em> became as
recommended as Rand, Rothbard and
Mises to newcomers. Rothbard urged us
to read G. Wiliam Domhoff’s <em>The Higher
 Circles</em> to study how the rich ran the
State for their own corporate—as opposed
 to free market—interests:
plutocracy!</p>
<p>By the summer of 1972, the New Left
was dead (Murray said so), McGovern
was a bigger threat than Nixon (Murray
spake again), and the Radical Libertarian
 Alliance, which had thundered against
 the plutocrats and vigilantly
sought out any taint of collaboration by
libertarians with “State Capitalists”,
had been transformed into “Young Republicans
 for Proxmire” and the “Citizens
 for a Restructured Republic”.</p>
<p>As usual, <em>Reason,</em> five years behind
the rest of the Movement, is only now
dealing with revisionist history. But this
time, it may indeed be time to revive the
anti-corporate crusade among libertarians,
 if for only two reasons: the position
is correct, and the time is right. Let me
back up both points.</p>
<p>Until last fall, I assumed that the corporation’s
 relationship to the State was
well understood by most libertarians.
Then I heard a talk at the Libertarian
Supper Club of Los Angeles by James
Carbone, a scientist and neo-Galambosian,
 now on the First Libertarian
Church’s board of directors. Carbone’s
altitude toward corporations, in which he
was hip-deep as a scientific research director,
 was naive but honestly inquiring.
 What did the rest of us libertarians
think of corporations?</p>
<p>To my utter surprise and dismay,
Robert LeFevre and Seymour Leon, two
West Coast big guns of hard-core libertarianism,
 actually defended the corporate
 concept. When Neil Schulman
and I offered the beginnings of the Old
Rothbardian (or Radical Libertarian)
analysis, we met incredulity and resistance
 from the majority of the audience—an
 audience of mostly jaded, “heard-it-all”
 Movement types.</p>
<p>The thing we could finally agree on as
a starting point is that the incorporation
and limited liability should not be enforced
 by law—but LeFevre, Leon and
others actually believe that the fiction of
“corporate responsibility” replacing individual
 responsibility would be voluntarily
 accepted in a free market. (I can’t
wait until we tackle the “fractional reserve”
 question for banks!)</p>
<p>Corporations are not a creation of the
marketplace. Corporations are not
joint-stock companies. Corporations are
not dodges around State regulations.
The only truth in all these myths is that
many otherwise free market businessmen
 accept incorporation rather than
counter-economic techniques—collaboration
 rather than resistance.</p>
<p>A joint-stock company (which is a perfectly
 free market institution) becomes a
corporation only through the agency of
the State. First of all, the State declares
(against the plain truth to everyone’s
eves) that a scrap of paper (charter) has
created a new individual where none was
born of woman (or man). But this individual
 is not only without flesh, it is limited
 in responsibility—it is privileged
(that is what the word means)—as in a
grant from a king. And, of course,
charters from kings were the means by
which corporations first came about.</p>
<p>The corporate shield absorbs all responsibilities—like
 pollution damage to
crops, nonpayment of debts, or defaults,
and so on—right up to disintegration
(bankruptcy). And still, the real human
beings behind the fiction are scot-free!</p>
<p>So much for theory—how has it
worked out in practice? Well. I’ll be
damned if I’m going to repeat Kolko,
Domhoff, C. Wright Mills, et al again.
So read the originals, or dig through
your back numbers of libertarian magazines
 to read the reviews. And take a
look at James J. Martin, a libertarian of
impeccable credentials (for example,
<em>Revisionist Viewpoints</em>), and acid Carl
Oglesby’s latest masterpiece, <em>The Yankee
 and Cowboy War.</em></p>
<p>The United States’ central State is
controlled by a small group of men and
women—the Higher Circles, the Power
Elite, the “conspiracy”—who intermarry
 in a social strata, attend the same social
 functions and belong to the same
clubs, constitute the membership of the
major policy-making organizations:
Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral
Commission, Committee for Economic
Development, Bilderbergers, etc.</p>
<p>Want names? David Rockefeller and
his academic friends Henry Kissinger
and Zbigniew Brzezinski (yes, “and”),
Prince Bernhard (until recently) of the
Netherlands and of Royal Dutch Shell,
Robert Anderson of ARCO, the Lazard
Freres and other Rothschild interest controllers,
 the major names of the J.P.
Morgan interests, the Kennedys, the
DuPonts, Mellons, Pews, Sulzbergers,
Sehifts, the other Rockefellers, Vances,
Helms, Sorensons, and so on. (See
New Libertarian Notes #28. “Introduction
 to Libertarian Ruling Class Theory”
by this author.)</p>
<p>[FIXME: link to NLN]</p>
<p>The corporate interests have been divided
 up along sectional lines, and according
 to degrees of entrenchment,
since the founding of the American
State (and even over the founding—see
Charles Beard’s Economic Interpretations
 of the Constitution). The Morgans
and Rockefellers fought over whether
there should be a World War I and
joined together for World War II. Then
came the nouveau riche, or should I say
nouveaux etatistes, from the West:
William Randolph Hearst, Howard
Hughes, the movie moguls, the computer
 entrepreneurs and the aerospace industries,
 The Cowboy and Yankee war
over Korea, Vietnam, Kennedy, Watergate,
 Nixon . . . here we are today.</p>
<p>But Hearst, Hughes and Getty are
dead: surely the Cowboys ride no more.
Ah, but look past the American frontier,
to western Canada, Alaska . . . and Australia.
 And sure enough, in rides Rupert
 Murdoch. The British establishment
calls for Anderson of ARCO to save the
venerable Observer from the parvenue
publisher, but that’s alright, he’s already
 got half the tabloid market in
London. And on to San Antonio, Texas,
and then to New York...</p>
<p>Wait a minute, that’s Yankee country,
their home! Murdoch buys up the New
York Post from ailing Dolly Schiff, and
then moves on New York and The Village
Voice. The Yankees intellectual sycophants
 run around like chickens with a
lox loose in the henhouse or a college of
cardinals who find that a Protestant has
just bought the Vatican—but to no avail,
NYM Co. falls and another inter-corporate
 struggle has begun. Who knows
what politicians may be assassinated or
Watergated this time? (Murdoch supported
 Carter, so it’s Morgan Yankees
and Texas Cowboys plus Murdoch vs
Rockefeller Yankees and Sun-Belt Cowboys.)</p>
<p>And then we could talk about the
USSR, Inc., the world’s most self-contained
 corporation, though not the richest
 or even the biggest. Yet the Soviet
Union acts just like a company with a
very big plant and facilities (and cheap
labor force), and owns huge blocks of
shares in many Western European,
Asian and even American companies.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the Seven Sisters:
these are the seven oil companies that
OPEC must sell to. There are Rothschild’s
 Royal Dutch Shell; British Petroleum:
 Texaco; Gulf; and three Rockefeller
 companies (Standard Oil before
the breakup): Exxon, Mobil, and Standard
 of California. Needless to say,
bank transactions of petrodollars go
through Chase Manhattan (David Rockefeller)
 Bank.</p>
<p>Enough. Can no one see this? How do
we get the message through to the
masses?</p>
<p>Too late—they’ve already got the message.
 While libertarians have been clinging
 to Rand’s competent capitalist idol,
or following those “hippies of the right”
like <em>Libertarian Connection</em>’s Skye
D’Aureous and Natalee Hall into grooving
 on the multi-national companies becoming
 too much for the national States
to handle, and others mentioned earlier
don’t even realize the problem, Hollywood
 has put out two excellent movies
portraying the possibility of the Corporation
 finally absorbing the State whole.</p>
<p><em>Rollerball</em> in 1975 showed the dystopia
starkly, with a hero who resembles liberty
 and individualism and single-handedly
 fights the enemy to a standstill.</p>
<p>The year 1976 gave us <em>Network.</em>
Besides having excellent satire on television
 and presenting the best mass-media
 portrait of a Marxist (black and female,
 no less) I’ve ever seen, the movie
spells out the corporativist philosophy
starkly in the mouth of the head of the
network’s parent corporation.</p>
<p>The message is “the present forms of
government just get in the way.”</p>
<p>It may dawn on you at this point what
I’m getting at, and you may indeed
flinch. Would any Libertarian Party candidate
 (or half the non-party libertarians,
for that matter) not hail the replacement
of the present world States with multi-national
 corporations, thus making “libertarianism”
 the co-opt for a New Statism,
 the way “liberalism” was a century ago?</p>
<p>There is a way out of this mess. Counter-economics
 cannot be co-opted. Moscow
 may be ready for Rollerball—but
it’s got the world’s biggest black market—and
 black market mentality in its
people (with the possible exception of
Burma). What if the corporations could
not enforce their monopolies because of
smugglers? What if the plutocrats could
not regulate because everyone was avoiding,
 evading or breaking regulations?
 What if the corporations watched
their limited liability, privileged market
shrivel up as business moved to an honest,
 righteous and enthusiastic underground
 market?</p>
<p>And finally, what if the enforcers—whether
 UN police, National Guard or
Company agents—going out after the
culprits, came back with stories of how
<em>everyone</em> is counter-economic—or maybe
 they didn’t come back at all . . .</p>
