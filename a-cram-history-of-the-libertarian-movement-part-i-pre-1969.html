            <h2>A Cram History of the Libertarian Movement. Part I Pre-1969</h2>
<h4>Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<p>In the beginning, man was free. Then he ran into his father.</p>
<p>Free philosophies have attempted to form throughout history, usually containing
just enough contradictions or errors to have them refuted and discarded like the statist
 theories they were to replace. Then we came along. The first we goes back to
William Godwin, the first anarchist, in the late 1700’s and traces through Josiah
Warren to Lysander Spooner. The limited government freaks can probably trace their
lineage to Jeremy Bentham’s Philosophical Radical Party in England (yes, dear reader,
the first “radicals” were limited archists), which, thanks to its utilitarian base
and John Stuart Mill, drifted toward Fabian democratic socialism. Meanwhile, back in
the U.S.A., Spooner was firming up a pro-property base for anarchy.</p>
<p>It is both fascinating to realize (as you will if you read even as little of
Spooner as No Treason) that if Praxeology had been added to Spooner’s position,
amending some of his views on economics, he would have reached the stage of development
 of the present Libertarian Movement, give or take a few deviationists, and dischartening
 to realize that a century has been wasted. This, gentle anarcho-objectivist,
 was all before Ayn Rand was a gleam in her father’s eye. Spooner was an active
abolitionist, shocking his comrades by supporting Southern secession, and demanding
that position as the only one consistent with slave secession from masters. His <em>No
Treason: The Constitution of No Authority</em> was published around 1870. He, along with
others, passed along the anarchist tradition to Benjamin Tucker, who was the first in
his line to call himself an anarchist from the Word Go.</p>
<p>Tucker also threatened to be the end of the line. His magazine Liberty was recognized
 as <em>the</em> radical journal until its demise in 1908. George Bernard Shaw acknowledges
 his debt to Tucker for making him famous, and was briefly an anarchist
himself through Tucker’s influence before continuing his meanderings on the political
spectrum through fascism and socialism. Tucker also laid into the anarcho-communists
of his time, setting westerners straight about Bakunin, Kropotkin, and their ilk.
Supposedly, when Tucker met Kropotkin, those attending expected sparks to fly; actually
 they merely exchanged salutations. . .</p>
<p>With the onslaught of World War I and the seduction of his radical friends into
what he scourged as “State Socialism,” Tucker despaired of the world and went to
France, dying in obscurity just prior to the Second World war. Some of those he had
influenced were followers of the school of Henry George economics, the “Single Taxers.”
 They believed (and still do) that Rent was immorally obtained, and that Land
should not be owned privately (although anything else could). Some of them believed
that government should at most collect this Rent and distribute it to the populace in
the form of services; a few believed that
this “social function” did not even require
 the state. Such a person was Albert
 J. Nook. Those in his Philosophical
camp around the turn of the century were
called Liberals (so was Herbert Spencer,
whom they were also familiar with), but
became Radicals with World War I and the
split caused by Wilson’s “betrayal” by
entering into war and foreign entanglements.
 Eventually, with the post-war
disillusionment, these Revisionists found
their war interpretation to become widely
 accepted, and during the twenties,
Nock, H. L. Mencken, and others were well-known
 and popular.</p>
<p>The Depression
and World war II
caused another estrangement
 of these neo-Georgist quasi-anarchists
 with the Liberals; first, because
they opposed Statist
solutions of the Hoover
 and later Roosevelt variety to the
economic problems of
the day, and second,
because they were opposed
 to Roosevelt’s
imperialism against
the Axis and the provocation
 of Japan into a totally avoidable
 war. These positions
 brought them into tactical alliance
 with the Old Right, an uneasy alliance.
 Their influence pervades—the Modern
 Right, as indicated by William Buckley’s
 inclusion of two Nock essays in
his definitive book on conservatism
called, <em>Did You Ever See a Dream walking?.</em>
 One of Nock’s essays was blatantly
 called “Anarchist’s Progress.” During
 this time, young Georgist Frank
Chodorov was brought into an anti-statist
 position by Nock’s influence, and
became one of the Right’s main activists,
founding the Intercollegiate Society of
Individualists and taking Over Mencken’s
American Mercury along with Buckley and
crowd. About this time, a Young Taft
Republican Columbia student named Murray
Rothbard read von Mises and became an economist,
 studying under the master himself.
The Taft wing or “Old Right” continued
their anti-imperialism through the Korean
war, while the liberals and social democrats
 insisted that Americans had a Duty
to save the world from Bolshevism. In
1953, Robert A. Taft died, unleashing a
Wisconsin Populist named Joseph McCarthy.
Chodorov’s remarks on McCarthyism indicate
the beginning of the end for the alliance:
“The way to get rid of Communists in government
 jobs is to get rid of the government
 jobs.” Unfortunately, William Buckley
 and his converted brother-in-law decided
 that Roman Catholicism was insufficiently
 motivating and
declared a Holy Crusade
against International
Communism. They began
by defending McCarthy
in print, and then, as
<em>American Mercury</em> fell
into the hands of racists,
 founded <em>National
Review</em> in 1955 and
staffed it with bitter
ex-Communists. Rothbard, who had made
 friends with many of
these people at the
time, such as <em>NR</em>’s ideologue, Frank Meyer,
 split with them in 1957
over irreconcilable foreign policy differences, as he Joined SANE
 and various Left peace
(for him, Isolationist)
groups, and the spectrum
flip-flopped. Around
this time the Objectivist philosophy was
turning into the personality cult of Ayn
Rand and Murray was invited to the formative
 get-togethers. Unfortunately, in 1950
he had already decided that the only consistent
 libertarian position was anarchy,
so he knew his days were numbered. Still,
he had some influence on the early Nathaniel
 Branden Institute students.</p>
<p>In 1960, the New Right got behind Barry
 Goldwater, who symbolized their new synthesis
 of pseudo-free enterprise at home and
American Imperialism abroad. The Youth for
Goldwater became, the following year, a
more ideological youth movement, meeting at
Buckley’s Sharon, Connecticut estate to form
a group of young conservatives. The National Chairman was Bob Schuchman (known to
Rothbard, incidentally) who demanded that the name be the Young Americans for Freedom.
Schuchman was the first and only libertarian Chairman.</p>
<p>The Goldwater campaign of 1964 brought vast recruits to YAF, and the subsequent
battles with the rising New Left, for which YAF was the only organized opposition,
sustained it in between the election years. Even objectivists began to join it,
though prohibited officially from it by Ayn Rand’s dictates. In 1967, a libertarian
caucus was formed from free market, ISI, and FEE style conservatives, semi-objectivists,
 and a few Rothbardians and even Georgists. They promised to really get it
together in 1969, the next biennial National Convention of YAF.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard Nixon was elected President, fulfilling every conservative’s
dream, and disillusioning every libertarian from his work with the Right, and Murray
Rothbard was into the Peace and Freedom Party, with many of his youthful converts moving
 past him into the SDS, where founders like Carl Oglesby were battling for Anarchy
against the Statist Maoists and Trotskyites who sought control of the group at any
expense. Jarret Wollstein split the Objectivist camp by coming out for anarcho-objectivism
 and the Society for Rational Individualism. And Nathaniel Branden fell from
grace.</p>
