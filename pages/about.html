            <h2>What it’s all about.</h2>
<p>We are a group of enthusiasts trying to make the legacy of Samuel Edward Konkin III
as widely available as humanly possible. Not all of what he wrote
is actual today but here we try to publish at least the most
important stuff that can be significant for the development of agorist
theory or practice. Pieces of libertarian theory, revisionist history,
book reviews, even some comments — they are all crucial to read if we
are to find out what kind of man Sam was and what he thought that wasn’t
included into books.</p>
<p><a href="../pages/wanted.html">List of materials we’d really, really like to have but don’t.</a></p>
<p>Feel free to ask and remember that sharing our links is the best donation.</p>
<h2>Other projects</h2>
<p>While this project concentrates on libertarian-related feature articles
that’s not all SEK3 created. He wrote two books and left several
more unfinished, edited a dozen of zines, newsletters, and other
periodicals, maintained his own personal fanzine (as <em>Clear Ether!</em>
and under other titles). Naturally, we have other projects concentrating
on those:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Personalzines (<em>Clear Ether!</em> and others) are being found,
  scanned and published on <a href="http://www.sek3.org/">sek3.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other fanzines and prozines (<em>New Libertarian</em>
  and others) are being scanned, OCRed, and will be published soon.
  Probably, in addition to the webbed articles, there will be
  the whole volumes of OCRed zines in eBook format.
  Stay tuned and contact us if you wanna help with it. For you can download this <a href="https://mega.nz/#F!mkNy2ZrA!7u1-yAVbRD38DkpB8bwKew">temporary near-complete New Libertarian scans collection in PDF and DJVU</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Books, both finished and unfinished, fiction and non-fiction,
  will soon be available as eBooks (EPUB and Kindle format).
  <em>New Libertarian Manifesto</em> and
  <em>An Agorist Primer</em> are available as print editions, thanks to KoPubCo,
  and PDFs can be found on the web. KoPubCo is also working on finishing
  <em>Counter-Economics</em>, the book.
  For everything else, again, stay tuned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to do if you disagree with our ideas</h2>
<p>Immediately go to facebook or your blog and write a lengthy
angry post about it, don’t forget to include a link to our site.</p>
<p>Please write everything you think about us there, what a vicious
bunch of ruthless agorists we are and how we want to destroy
everything you believe in. Also feel free to ask you friends to repost
this important information (with our link, of course) all over the web.</p>
<p>But do not contact us about it under any circumstances unless you
want to give us something we need (like if you want to get
rid of some rare anarchist magazines), we have more important
stuff to do, you know.</p>
