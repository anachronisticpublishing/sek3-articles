            <h2>At the Youth Conference</h2>
<h4>by Sam Konkin</h4>
<!--FIXME: place photo here? or wait till better-quality scan is available?-->

<p><em>we came, we saw, we converted</em></p>
<p>Pleasantly surprised by the 75 degree weather we encountered
arriving at Denver’s airport, far higher than predicted, we
continue by a long bus ride to Estes Park, Colorado. After the
first night, we awoke to heavy snowfall and deficient plumbing.
Nature was foreshadowing an allegory of the White House
Conference on Youth.</p>
<p>From April 18 to April 22, budding young
establishmentarians, reform-tripping on parliamentary procedure,
and a few free-loading radicals condensed from around the world
to Estes Park, the new mecca for Meeting Freaks.
Several invitations to the Conference were passed along the
spectrum from conservative to less conservative libertarians; most
invitations were ultimately turned down. Final judgement as to
who should receive the applications for invitations ended in the
hands of Society for Individual Liberty / California Libertarian
Alliance axis leadership, and led to complaints by Eastern RLA of
exclusion. Nevertheless, all three libertarians who swallowed their
repugnance of attending a purely statist function, (not to
mention repugnance of the food served there) were RLA’ers and
openly wore black flag buttons. Besides myself, Ron Kimberling
of California and Marshall Beerwinkle of Texas were present.
Two more left anarchists. Sissy Kelly of D.C. and Joost van Nimis
(International Delegate who attended Dartmouth) put on RLA
buttons during the Conference. All were on different task forces.</p>
<p>At first a libertarian caucus was considered and rudimentary
efforts were made to create it. To our surprise, the formation of
an Anarchist Caucus was announced, and so, the RLA’ers trudged
through the snow to the outlying cabin where the meeting was to
be held. The meeting was called by a press delegate of a
University of California paper, and attended by <em>Village
Voice</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em> reporters. No concrete proposals
emerged from the ten people there, but much joyful chemistry
was in evidence; nor did anyone stay around for the Free
Enterprise Caucus that was to follow in that cabin. Most of the
group broke off to attend the Press Conference where the
aforementioned chemistry acted as a crap-repellent. Those
interested in the details of the Press Conference can contact Ron
Kimberling, c/o CLA, Box 572, Santa Ana, Cal. RLA attendance
of the Task Force meetings with the exception of two converts,
was poor, but coffeehouse attendance, where acid rock light
shows were held, was excellent.</p>
<p>The libertarian delegates spent most of their time with
delegates interested in libertarianism. Some libertarian influence
was exhibited in the Preamble and Report of the draft Task
Force. The Drug Task Force advocated legalization and regulation
of marijuana, and the right to use other drugs coupled
with <em>increased</em> persecution of dealers, split libertarian ranks. I
made my only address to the Assembly: an impassioned attack on
regulations and control. The remaining libertarians felt their
personal safety from arrest was more important than battling for
principle, and quietly voted for the Report. No other measure
evoked action by RLA at the Conference, and voting was split on
other issues. On example of this was the Vietnam
recommendation demanding complete American withdrawal but
massive US aid in “reparations” which I felt was continuing
Imperialism in a more “accepted” guise. Fortunately another
decade must pass before the State will hold another White House
Co-opt of Youth.</p>
