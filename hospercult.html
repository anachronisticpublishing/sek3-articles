            <h4>Samuel Edward Konkin 3rd</h4>
<h2>Hosperscult</h2>
<p>In January 1973, Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarchocolumnist (YFNA—ed.) tore into
shreads an article written by John Hospers, Ph. D. The article fuzzed up the archy/anarchy
controversy, and it will probably be viewed historically as the last ditch defense of minarchy
 through obfuscation. As far as I know, Hospers has ceased &amp; desisted in this area.</p>
<p>Let me keep the fuzz out of one realm: personalities. Go-betweens inform me that Dr.
John was offended by a lowly doctoral candidate in theoretical chemistry blowing his professorial
 dissertation. Of course, <em>scientists</em> are required to use rigour and logic on a day-to-day
 basis... No, the good doctor need not feel miffed and was assured of no rancor.
Since his Abaco fomenting, he seems to have broadened his outlook and is developing quite
admiringly. As a person.</p>
<p>The critique I wrote was part of a general attack on REASON. The magazine has improved
somewhat since then, printing some tame anarchists; and, as I said, so has Hospers. But a
new phenomenon has arisen, one which evokes guffaws as a response, hardly deserving of the
ponderous artillery of Aristotle.</p>
<p>I refer to Hosperscult.</p>
<p>YFNA has seen many “cults of personality”
 come and go. When he came along
in 1969, Rand was out, Branden was in
decline, Leonard Read was receding, and
LeFevre and Rothbard were shining. Above
all was the intellectual giant, Ludwig
von Mises.</p>
<p>These were individuals of achievement,
 men and women who stood as examples
of the efficacy of a single person—the
unique one. The heresy of “following” an
individualist is damning enough—but so
easily understandable.</p>
<p>All of them earned this respect. By
their own efforts. In the all-too-hostile
 marketplace. Nobody “voted” them
awards... until much past their prime.</p>
<p>What then can we think of a movement
which honours those of no visible achievement?
 Surely libertarians, anti-Statists
of all persuasions, cannot regard vote-getting
 as a worthy achievement!</p>
<p>But, for the sake of a column, let’s
suppose that we can admire it as an accomplishment
 of some sort—as we might admire
 the Isolationist aspects of Hitler’s
or Mao’s foreign policy even while recoiling
 in choking fury from their domestic.
 Very well. Now, let’s see, how many
votes <em>did</em> Hospers get?</p>
<p>No John C. Fremont here. Again, lest
poor Doc John feel put upon, let us throw in
Fran <em>“I Bring Much”</em> Youngstein, who got one-third
 as many votes as she got petition signatures!
 And let us mercifully forget the
quixotic campaigns of Messrs. Block and Greenberg,
 with their ballotophelic “Outlook.” One
thing we can say about libertarian candidates
in general—they sure don’t threaten us with
their charisma. That is, they are not going
to turn the general public into fanatical arm-banded
 followers for a coup.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> charismatic libertarians. Dana
Rohrbacher and Robert LeFevre come quickly to
mind. Is it coincidence that they are anti-“political”?</p>
<p>I would urge upon my fellow libertarians
an end to attacks on—and thus defense of—the
professor. Let him gracefully slip away after
the coming debacle in California for the LP
there, and get back to his work of self-improvement.
 Perhaps his greatness lies waiting
yet to blossom, and we are distracting and
stunting it by dumping on all this fertilizer
prematurely.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Libertarian Party could move
back in tune with the Movement by offering a
joke candidate. Someone whose only claim to
political accomplishment is the acquisition of
a meaningless office, and who would campaign in
a whimsical, folksy, one-of-the-rednecks
manner. Like an Electoral College graduate.</p>
<p>I can see it all now: “Don’t Leave
MacBride at the Altar—He’s the Best Man!”</p>
