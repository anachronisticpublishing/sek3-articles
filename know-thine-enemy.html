            <h2>Know Thine Enemy!</h2>
<h3>1941—1973</h3>
<h4>by Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I have read both Higher
 Circles[1] land Conspiracy[2]
 but fail to see
how talking about
“THEM” advances libertarian
 thinking.</p>
<p>—David F. Nolan, postscript
 to last of the
Nolan-Konkin Letters
(NLN 15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year is 1941, and
you are there. You have
sat at the knee of Albert
J. Nock, perhaps along with Frank Chodorov.
 You dig through old bookstores to
find books by Lysander Spooner and
trade copies of Benjamin Tucker’s <em>Liberty</em>
 with the “Remnant” like yourself.
You speak out, perhaps on a campus,
against “that man in the White House,”
and his eclectic but statist economics.
You are a libertarian activist, perhaps
ahead of your time. And there is a
bloody holocaust in Europe.</p>
<p>Many of the people you associate
with on the Right, represented by Eugene
 Lyons’ <em>American Mercury,</em> are for
going to war against National Socialism
and Fascism, extreme Leftist ideologues
viciously out to uproot and radicalize
anything remotely “conservative.” According
 to the information available at
the time[3] they intend to ravage Europe
like a horde of Huns, with fire and
sword, blood and iron. Next to them,
the Bolsheviks seem safe, tame, and non-interventionist.</p>
<p>The Left is almost universally opposed
 to American participation, at
least until June; then the bellicose,
more-American-than-thou Communists
“Wrap themselves in the American Flag
so you can hardly see the hammer-and-sickle”
 and join the crusade against
their erstwhile ally, and split with
the predominately pacifist Socialists.[4]
The ideologues and purveyors of political
 nostrums scream for “War!”, to save
the Jews, the French, the Russians, Europe,
 Asia. . . the World! And you?</p>
<p>Even with this background,
 you may be ready to go
along. After all, nothing is
more statist than Fascism,
right? Would it not be worth
it to use limited states (such
as the U.S. and Great Britain)
against the totalitarians?</p>
<p>This fork in the road towards
 either successful anti-state
 strategy or towards becoming
 dupes of the power
elite creates a choice which
requires additional information
to rationally make. Suppose, unlike many
of your friends and allies, you have been
talking to the Harry Elmer Barneses, the
Charles Beards, and their students—talking
 about THEM: the ruling class, power
elite, superstatists, etc. You know from
Franz Oppenheimer (through Nock) that the
State splits society into two classes:
those that make a net gain by its existence
 (the “exploiters”) and those that
lose (the “exploited”) and leading those
whose wealth is amassed by wholesale theft
and murder, the elite plutocrats who the
Revisionists expose. You know how they
caused World War I, and the financial killings
 (non-market, needless to say) the
Warburgs, Mellons, and Shiffs made. You
look for signs of that around you.</p>
<p>And if you look deep enough, they are
there. Speeches of “Liberal” bureaucrats
exhorting support for the newly enacted
draft and the mobilizing War Machine.[6]
Plans in the “in” Journals for heavy economic
 controls, cartelization, and nationalization
 as in World War I—but these
won’t be dismantled this time.[7] You see
Roosevelt meeting with Churchill, promising
 him all support “short of war,”
and then see his actions: U.S. Navy ships
firing on Axis submarines, U.S. “gift” of
50 destroyers to the U.K., U.S. invasion
of Iceland, U.S. support to China in the
Far East, U.S. embargo of Japan, U.S.
seizure of all Japanese assets in the U.S.,
U.S. refusal to negotiate with an almost
begging Japan unless Japan denounces all
her allies,
abandons all territories outside its own islands, and completely reverses her foreign
 policy to subservience under the U.S.[8]</p>
<p>With an ounce of morality in you, you Join America First! You campaign
against Roosevelt’s actions, and expose him at [FIXME: missed text?] every turn. You
burn your fellow libertarians’ ears with your Revisionism so they won’t support
the domestic power grab, and tell everyone to fight the fascism at home, leaving
Europe to fight its own. You may fail when the Japanese are driven to bomb
Pearl Harbor to get “them” before “they” get the Japanese, causing the American
populace to drop their isolationism and follow Roosevelt. And the Germans fall
into the trap by almost insanely living up to their Pact with Japan, even though
their hands are full in Africa and Russia. But thirty years later, a new, resurgent
 libertarian movement arises out of the Right and Left where your allies
had become dupes, denouncing them for their folly, and looking back for trades of
your heroic opposition for their new inspiration.</p>
<p>Today, the “Peace” movement rolls over, fetches, and does-simple tricks for
Richard Nixon when it comes to his foreign policy. An era of detente, thawing of
the Cold War, peace everywhere, myths shattering, and the Wall Street Barons realizing
 the limitations of U.S. “world policeman” role. What shivers of ecstacy!</p>
<p>What a pile ordure to any Revisionist with his nose open! China, manipulated
 into a paranoia of Russians, reversing policy to desiring U.S. presence in
Asia as a “counter-balance”! The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, finally
paying the price of following Marxist zero-think on agricultural economics and
starving, goes hat in hand to the U.S., begging for food. The terms are $24 million
 a year, to pay a debt (until 2001) neither the Russian slaves nor even their
present masters incurred thirty years before, to repay not the individuals residing
 in North America who had originally been ripped-off for 100-times as much,
but those who follow in the footsteps of the thieves. In short, every Russian is
paying a dime a year tribute to the Empire of America.</p>
<p>Pepsi-Cola is granted a monopoly by the Soviet statist to sell cola, in exchange
 for the Monsieur Henri wines branch of Pepsi selling Russian booze in the
U.S. Monopolies coming and going as the U.S. power elite shows their junior
partners in Moscow how to rake it off. Favors are thrown to the agri-plutocrats
in the form of a grain deal windfall along with cut-rate prices to the properly
humbled Soviet satraps—at U.S. taxpayer expense. Imperium reigns and Pax Americana
 rules the world.</p>
<p>Rumor has it David Rockefeller wants his grandchildren named Julius and
Augustus.</p>
<p>And, the advanced elements of the Libertarian Party investigates Building
graft in New York City.</p>
