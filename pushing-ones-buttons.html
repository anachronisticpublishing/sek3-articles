            <h2>Pushing One’s Buttons</h2>
<h4>by Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<p>[Refer to the whole issue of The Voluntaryist if you want to know about the button thing more and read the Watner’s article. —dig.ed.]</p>
<p>Carl Watner seems to approvingly cite Robert LeFevre in
contrast to Leonard Read concerning pushing a
hypothetical button that would end all price controls immediately.
I first came across a version of this when Murray Rothbard
declared, at the 1969 Libertarian Conference in New York City’s
Hotel Diplomat, that if offered a button that would do away with the
State apparatus on the spot, he would “blister his finger pushing
the button.” The bold challenge was hurled, thus, not only to
LeFevre but to Read.</p>
<p>There are two problems with the dichotomy presented: first, the
actual opposition of the two premises; second, the interpretation
of the hypotheses involved and their consequences.</p>
<p>It is far less obvious to me than it was to LeFevre that one must,
to use his term, abdicate Abdication (of State power) in order to
push this magic button. Neither Read nor Rothbard bothered to
conjecture how such a button <em>arose.</em> Suppose that a group of
agorists had somehow managed to buy up all the network and
cable television time at a certain time of day and spent considerable
 advertising funds to induce most of the populace to watch.
You are placed before the button which will run the videotape of a
George Lucas-produced grabber which rivets the audience to
their seat and gets most of them to listen to a new and improved
John Galt speech. Upon hearing the words and absorbing the
visuals, a sufficient number of people quit their statist jobs, refuse
to obey regulations and pay taxes, and possibly defend their
neighbors should they be harassed by the few remaining State
thugs. (Pacifists may drop the final consequence.) The agorists
accomplished the set-up without violating anyone’s rights. The
situation is highly speculative and, alas, quite unlikely, but
definitely possible. We now have a reasonable pathway to the
Rothbard-improved Read hypothesis.</p>
<p>Would Robert LeFevre fail to push <em>that</em> button?</p>
<p>If at least one case can be drawn where the Button-Pushing <em>vs</em>
Abdication are <em>not</em> in opposition, then the dichotomy fails. Those
who are unable to construct others lack imagination.</p>
<p>Now let’s explicitly deal with interpretation. Suppose I’m offered
two buttons. One button will accomplish the end above with the
specified means. The other button was connected to the White
House “hot line” and would signal my acceptance of the
presidency: in desperate straits as the State is rapidly collapsing
from massive counter-economic activity, the dying Executive and
rump Congress offer me total power (because I seem to know
what the hell is going on) to save the situation the best way I can.
I’m as convinced as I could be that they are willing to grab at
anything and will accept at least my initial edicts. In fact, due to
their experience with Friedmanite reform economists, they even
expect that most of my dictates will involve abolishing huge
chunks of the State, hopefully (to them) saving <em>something.</em></p>
<p>Set up that way, it is still too easy to take the moral path. I’m even
sure Murray Rothbard would push Button One. So let’s add one
more condition to get a bit of realism.</p>
<p>We do not <em>know</em> how either group will react. In fact, we are
suspicious that we have not yet done sufficient preparatory work
and the populace may enjoy the show but there’s a good chance
not enough of them are ready to go the rest of the way. And if we
push Button One, we have blown our chance for Button Two, for
the State’s agents on hands will immediately report our “treason.”
For whatever reason, we seem to be more sure that the statists are
in dire enough straits to carry out their promises this time. Now
which one shall we press?</p>
<p>I cannot speak for all voluntaryists, but I certainly hope each
and every Agorist would blister his or her finger along with me
pushing the button for the Lady of Liberty and not the Tiger of
Statism. Push the button <em>and</em> abdicate.</p>
