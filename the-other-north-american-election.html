            <h2>The Other North American Election</h2>
<h4>By Samuel Edward Konkin III</h4>
<p>While Richard Nixon bored everyone with his landslide on November 7,
Canadians were treated to a cliff-hanger a week earlier on October 30.
The pollsters confidently predicted a Trudeau return as Maritime
provinces’ results swung slightly towards the Liberal Party, and Quebec
cut the Progressive Conservative seats from four to two (out of 74). True,
the Social Credit Rally (Ralliement Creditiste) increased their popular
vote substantially, but gained only one seat. Then Ontario came in with
the social democratic New Democrat Party and the Progressive Conservatives
 slashing into the Grit (Liberal) standings. And then the West.</p>
<p>In Alberta, all four Liberal seats were buried under a Tory (PC)
avalanche. British Columbia moved the Tories even with the Grits, and
brought in the NDP main strength. The Northwest Territories gave the
NDP their first “frontier” seat (Grit loss) and the Tories held on to the
Yukon to put them one seat up, 109-108.</p>
<p>Canada does not allow absentee balloting, except for one special case.
The Social Credit Party’s sole gain was at the expense of Jean-Luc Pepin,
a Liberal Cabinet Minister involved in what Murray Rothbard called
Quebec’s “White Terror” suspension of civil rights of a few years ago,
and, since the Creditistes are the federal party which most free market
libertarians (especially minarchists) in the U.S. would sympathize with,
it seemed like divine justice. Unfortunately, the military votes Grit, and
their absentee ballots reversed the 100-vote margin, knocking the
Creditistes back to 14 seats. Libertarians can probably read symbolism
into that as well.</p>
<p>The final standings of 109 seats each for the Liberals and P. C.’s, 30 for
the NDP, 14 for SC, one Independent Conservative and one Independent
(speaker of the House Lucien Lamoureux—non-partisan) tell the
average American nothing, assuming he even heard of them. For the
libertarians wanting of know who to cheer and who to boo—as Dr.
Rothbard is wont—even less. I shall undertake here to give you a
programme to go with your scorecard.</p>
<p>The Social Credit Party used to be based in the rightist West, Alberta
and British Columbia, and was a free market, pro-American party with a
funny money policy they could not legislate because they had only controlled
 provincial governments. They never had more than a minority in
the national House of Commons. In 1963, they defeated John Diefen-baker’s
 minority Tory government because he failed to balance the
budget. In 1962, Real Caouette led his Quebecers into the House in larger
numbers than the Western wing, and the party eventually split. The
Western wing withdrew in favor of P. C.’s to stem the Trudeau sweep of
1968, and never recovered. Caouette kept his more orthodix Social Credit
position, appealing populistically to the Quebec habitants (peasant
farmers) and stayed in the House. Recently he tried to expand westward,
but failed to restore the party outside Quebec (although there are still a
few Socred diehards lurking in rightist circles in ranch and oil country).
The Alberta provincial Socreds were thrown out of office for the first
time in 35 years in 1970 by Kennedyesque Tory Peter Lougheed, and their
very survival as a party depends on Lougheed’s self-destruction. This 
year in British Columbia, W. A. C. Bennett’s 20-year Socred regime was
ousted by the NDP in an even greater victory, marking a swing from far
Right to far Left in the Canadian four-party spectrum. Although Caouette
increased his popular vote markedly, and signs of organization were seen
again throughout Canada, the recent net effect for the “good guys” (least
worst guys) is down.</p>
<p>The Leftist bad guys, the New Democrat Party, which is labour backed
and oriented, like the British Labour Party, now has three provincial
governments (B. C, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) and their largest
number of seats ever in the Federal House. American investors are fleeing
 B. C. right now, and Canadian capitalists are screaming to the federal
government to bail them out by preventing nationalization of federal
regulated industries. <em>Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.</em></p>
<p>The big gains federally were reaped by Robert Stanfield’s Progressive
Conservative Party, but it cannot take over the government without 25
more seats—and the Creditistes haven’t got that many. The Tories are
conservative, but in the British/European sense, not (except for a small
Ontario faction) in the American quasi-libertarian sense. Hence they love
mercantilism and fear gradual socialism much less. Thus NDP support
for the right Welfarist concessions is thinkable, and the NDP’s and PC’s
both are anti-American (just as the Liberals and SC’s are pro-American).
Their foreign policy might seem more appealing to a libertarian; but it
manifests itself in increasing government regulation of corporations
(50% of Canadian companies are American controlled) and in little which
could be considered objective anti-imperialism. The NDP leader, David
Lewis, will “throw his support behind whichever of the old line parties is
prepared to deal adequately with unemployment, inflation, old age pensions,
 and a more equitable tax system.”[1] Coming from a socialist, that seems
ominous. I doubt that libertarians could imagine a worse nightmare
 than a de facto socialist-traditionalist coalition.</p>
<p>Trudeaumania is gone, but Pierre Elliot Trudeau clings on. He has not
resigned, and it looks as if he will try to keep governing, daring the Opposition
 to precipitate an election by defeating him on a non-confidence
motion. Here, precedent is murky. There is no reason the figurehead
Governor-General can’t ask the Tories to try to gain confidence for a
majority—but in 1926, Governor General Lord Byng refused Liberal
Mackenzie King’s request for dissolution of Parliament, and invited
Conservative Arthur Meighen to govern. His bungling Progressive supporters
 blew a “pairing”, bringing him down only days later, and William
Lyon Mackenzie King rode to victory attacking Byng’s interference.
Would Roland Michener have the guts of Lord Byng? Ultimately, the
Tories may be thwarted by this vestige of royal privilege. Michener was a
Conservative, to add to the irony, but was appointed by a Liberal government,
 following a recent cross-party tradition.</p>
<p>Still, Trudeau has a problem if Michener doesn’t give him an issue. The
electorate might decide to finish the job by giving Stanfield a majority.
Diefenbaker ended 22 years of Liberal government in 1957, and dissolved
his minority government early in 1958 calling for just such a majority. He
won a record 208 out of 265 seats.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lester Bowles Pearson won two minority
governments in a row of 1963 and 1965 after a Tory minority of 1962, failing
 to get the majority he craved. He limped along in the Centre, depending
 on Social Credit support.</p>
<p>It is in the Grits’ interest to give the Tories the government, so that
Stanfield can begin to alienate voters. But it’s not in Trudeau’s interest,
as shown by Diefenbaker’s ouster after his election defeat by a particularly
 brutal purge which caused enough resentment in the West to
give Trudeau his 1968 victory in the first place. Trudeau’s ouster would
not be so regionally oriented, because half of the Liberal seats are in
Quebec anyway, and his followers have nowhere to go but the Creditistes,
the Tories being unthinkable and the NDP frowned on by the Catholic
Church.</p>
<p>The French-English split is being played up by foreign papers, and the
Separatists may be bolstered by the defeat of their centralist enemy
Trudeau—but that is a Provincial effect, not a Federal one. Furthermore,
 resentment against compulsory bilingualism/biculturalism is
found in the third of the population of non-WASP origin (mostly in the
West) such as German, Ukrainian, Galician, Icelander, Dutch, Russian,
and others who are just speaking English in the first or second generation.
 The only real amelioration will be found in reviving the Social Credit
and Union Nationale’s (a Quebec provincial party, recently defeated by
the Grits) demand for greater decentralism and provincial rights. The
present trend is the other way, but Canadians are a remarkably non-revolutionary
 lot, pointing with pride to their “evolution” from Great
Britain, as opposed to the Americans’ messy violence. Quebec independence
 will be gained gradually if at all, by the Parti Quebec
parliamentarily (with both RIN-socialistic-and RN-Creditiste-wings) and
not by the ten to fifteen FLQ[2] goons.</p>
<p>Revolution in Canada is a bigger joke than in the U.S., and rather than
radical change, resulting from elimination of Trudeau’s flashy, slightly-leftist
 liberalism (he flirted with price controls but never implemented
them, by the way) one should expect stodginess, anti-communist witch-hunts
 from Liberal renegade Paul Hellyer, and the ominous economic
changes resulting from NDP support. Canadian libertarians and their
American allies should be hoping for a new election and a minority
government with Creditiste swing vote power. Failing that, how about
Parliamentary Chaos?</p>
