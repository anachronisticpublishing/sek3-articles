            <h2>The Global Anarchovillage</h2>
<h4>Samuel E. Konkin 3rd</h4>
<p>Oft times have you heard from Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist (YFNA) of the necessity
 of Counter-Economics, and from YFNA and
others of its perils and inherent risks. This
time I’ll lay on you a bit of its joy. This anecdote
 is true, though I’ve fiddled and omitted a
bit for “security” reasons. And it begins in the
Counter-Economy.</p>
<p>This is the City, Los Angeles, Calif. I work
here. I’m an anarchist. (Fill in your own music.)</p>
<p>Sunday, 10 a.m. I was working on an “independent
 consultant” caper for my anarcho-buddy
Leon. Deadline was rapidly approaching, and we
both hoped a full Sunday would get us back on
schedule. I had arrived early and was churning
out marketable productivity.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was under attack. Pain. Excruciating.
 Growing. I had to stop.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t the State this time (though,
ultimately, I suppose, one <em>could</em> find it involved
somewhere!). No, it was that old debbil toothache.
O misspent youth! Visions of sugarplums danced
wickedly in my head, and my tooth throbbed in
rhythm to this savage beat.</p>
<p>Of course, good Anarcho-buddy Leon was concerned
 for my welfare. (There goes the deadline,
he was thinking.) So we called around L.A. to
find a dentist. On a Sunday.</p>
<p>Nothing. Zip-all. Nihil.</p>
<p>Faith in the Market wavering, we hearkened
to a suggestion from one of the answering services
of a guy who said he’d drive in from Glendale,
but it would <em>cost</em> me... We were told that the
University of California at Los Angeles and the
University of Southern California maintained
emergency dentists. UCLA is completely statist,
so we went to USC (which was also much closer).
Leon dropped me off, and I wandered through the
corridors of the sick, maimed and hypochondriac.</p>
<p>Such sufferings—and was I sympatico. Half
the bureaucrats never heard of dentists there,
and the doctors (at least they were wearing white
coats, etc.) kept pointing out new bureaucrats.
Some efficient-seeming secretary brusquely told
me the dentist was not there, that it was a myth,
and to stop wasting my time. I did.</p>
<p>It had not rained (what I consider rain)
in Los Angeles for months. Today it was drizzling
steadily. I hopped a bus back to Leon’s, phoning
him during a transfer. He agreed to call UCLA.</p>
<p>UCLA confirmed that their dentist was
equally mythological. Now we looked through
the yellow pages, calling a few who boldly advertised
 that they were open late hours and
weekends for emergencies. I guess their crystal
ball told them there weren’t going to be any this
Sunday. They were out. See you Monday morning.</p>
<p>Leon, fretting at the time lost, had purchased
 a palliative. I dutifully, but skeptically,
 smeared benzocaine all over the aching
area. He swore that it would work and that he
had personally seen it work on someone who had
worked for him recently.</p>
<p>It didn’t work. Nor was anything else
working. Including me.</p>
<p>“Isn’t there anybody else?” I queried,
resigning myself to a sleepless night, a forfeited
 deadline, and dread anticipation of a
dental visit. (Yes, I have an irrational, whim-worshipping,
 utterly childish, but paranoid <em>fear</em>
of dentists.)</p>
<p>He dialed one last time, an ad that looked
a bit dubious to him, open 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
7 days. It sounded very unprofessional. He
was <em>not</em> recommended by the California Dental
Society, which had recommended several golf-players
 earlier.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said the female gum-chewing voice,
“the doctor will see you at his home, but he
wants me to tell you in advance it’s $30.”</p>
<p>Sure. Leon drove me to Hollywood, making
comments on the relatively poor neighborhood,
and what kind of dentist would be hard up
enough to take a patient on a Sunday evening.</p>
<p>I helpfully suggested he might be a junkie
and needed the bread.</p>
<p>We arrived at a false-front house, the
door was buzzed open by remote control, and
“Dr. Jack” let us in, to a house, yard, and
connected garage in the back. We were to go
straight to the back.</p>
<p>All over the walls were posters denouncing
wicked qualities in food. Leaflets denounced
Coca-Cola as poison and ice cream as sugared
putrefaction. Leon, being a native Californian,
was not put out much, but I groaned. A food
faddist.</p>
<p>Doc Jack came in, sat me down, looked in
my mouth, and whipped in the never-to-be-sufficiently-damned
 needle. The pain subsided. He
gave me a card to fill out and talked briefly
to Leon on the literature.</p>
<p>He said the tooth could be saved by something
 called root-canal therapy. I said I could
care less, I got plenty of teeth, but you’re
the doctor. Just kill the pain for good. (I
suppose I am giving away the depth of my mind-body
 dichotomy here. Ah, well, anything for a
better story.) He had a pile of diplomas, I noticed,
 and Leon remarked that USC had a good
reputation.</p>
<p>I mentioned, as I filled out the card,
that the California Dental Society had been no
help in finding him. He said he quit several
years ago. Great.</p>
<p>He looked under “employer” where I had written
 “New Libertarian Enterprises.” “What’s new
about it?” he asked.</p>
<p>This quack, about to butcher my one and
only mouth, is questioning me? OK. I’ll humour
him. Maybe he still remembers enough of his
training to get me through.</p>
<p>“What do you do?” he persisted.</p>
<p>“I work as an independent consultant. I’m
gown here from Canada on a (CENSORED BY AUTHOR)
job.”</p>
<p>I added lamely, “It’s for tax purposes.”</p>
<p>He then said, “Have you ever heard of the
Free Enterprise Institute?”</p>
<p>Oh no, I thought, don’t tell me he’s got it
in for libertarians? He’s actually heard of us!</p>
<p>“Uh, that’s Andrew J. Galambos’ organization,
right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said, “I took six years of courses
before I split with him three years ago.”</p>
<p>Holy anarchoshit! An anarcho-dentist! I
was having my tooth fixed in the ever-lovin’
Counter-Economy.</p>
<p>So Leon rapped with Jack about Galambos,
while my anesthesized mouth was uncharacteristically
 silent. Doc Jack told us he hadn’t paid
taxes in four or five years. Considering he got
$140 more from me for less than half an hour of
“root canal therapy,” he’s a good example to us
all.</p>
<p>He gave us a brief attack on how soft-core
the Dental Society was on preventative (as opposed
to restorative) dentistry, and I gave him an NLW
and he Xeroxed the LIBERTARIAN SUPPER CLUB BULLETIN
 I was carrying.</p>
<p>So that explained why he was working Sundays;
 he believed in the Market. Faith and health
restored, I left to return to work.</p>
<p>But it did get me thinking. The next time
some libertarian needs me in the marketplace, will
I be available? (I put in a solid week of overtime,
 and we got everything out, by the way. Happy
ending.)</p>
<p>And you?</p>
