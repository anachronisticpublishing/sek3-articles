<h2>Revisionism Today</h2>
<p>Briefly summarized, the study of revisionism
should teach us this:</p>
<p>1. The raison d’être of the State is theft;
that is, acquiring wealth by political rather than
economic means.</p>
<p>2. Those individuals whose wealth depends on
coercion rather than free trade will use all their
wealth necessary to control as much of the State
apparatus as other groups also competing for such
power allow them.</p>
<p>3. Such individuals (the power elite, plutocracy,
 “conspiracy,” or “ruling class”) maintain a
common front for statism, but must inherently divide
when some of their interests are attacked by the
state mechanism for the gains of other plutocrats.</p>
<p>In the past, the railway companies supported
the regulation of transport for cartelization. As
cartelization grew, “progressives” advocated govt.
intervention to correct the original statist intrusion.
 The Morgan financial-industrial Eastern
interests supported Theodore Roosevelt and ousted
the McKinley regime so that Roosevelt could institute
 antitrust action against the Midwestern Rockefeller
 interests. Rockefeller backed fellow Ohioan
William Howard Taft, who used the same weapon against
 the Morgans. Morgan then used Roosevelt to
split the Republicans and backed Wilson.</p>
<p>World War 1 saw Morgan interests heavily invested
 on the Allied side and in danger of bankruptcy.
 Against Rockefeller opposition, the Morgan-Warburg-Rothschild
 grouping of international financiers
 brought the U.S. into the war to bail out
their investments. Rockefeller backed “isolationists”
 such as Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., and with the
support of the quasi-libertarian populace ousted
the Warmongers in Congress in 1918, and Wilson in
1920.</p>
<p>During the war, the intellectual community
split, with proto-libertarians such as Albert J. Nock
and Oswald Garrison Villard attacking Wilson and his
new “court intellectuals” for selling out “liberalism.”</p>
<p>Robert M. LaFollette lead the Progressives
against the Morgan-interest war. He went down to
crushing defeat in his 1924 presidential race,
dying finally a true enemy of the power elite.</p>
<p>Rapidly running down a list of presidential
contenders and the foreign policy each stood for, we
find in the Rockefeller-interest camp: Harding,
Coolidge, Hoover (and Pacific warmonger Stimson in
his cabinet), Wilkie, Dewey, and, of course, Ike.</p>
<p>In the Morgan-interest camp were the following:
Cox, Davis, Al Smith, Roosevelt, Truman, Stevenson,
and Kennedy. Two of the latter were “coalition”
candidates with support from people outside the
Eastern-Midwestern “higher circles.”</p>
<p>World War 2 was fought when the Rockefellers
were bought off by a Pacific war by the Morganites,
who were pursuing an interventionist European policy.
With the “Cold War” setting up Imperial colonies for
all the major statist corporations of the U.S., the
Morgan/Rockefeller split was “rationalized” (Gabriel
Kolko’s term).</p>
<p>In the 1950’s, new money emerged in Texas
(oil and computers), South Florida (land and Space),
Southern California (entertainment and aircraft),
and the Pacific Northwest (aircraft and munitions).
These nouveau-riche were termed the “Cowboys” by Carl
Oglesby in contrast to the Eastern “Yankees.”</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy was a Morgan Yankee, with LBJ
his Cowboy running mate. Richard Nixon was a Calif.
Cowboy with Henry Cabot Lodge his Rockefeller-Yankee
running mate.</p>
<p>The power of the Yankees was most blatantly
exhibited between 1964 and 1974, the decade in which
they were most threatened. During this time, Cowboys
ran the U.S. presidency but Yankees ran the country
and literally drove from office every Cowboy contender.
When Johnson acquired the presidency through Cowboy
assassination (the CIA is Yankee-run at the top via
the State Dept. and appointed directors, but the
agents.are largely Cowboy-leaning), the Morgans were
toppled. Then Goldwater’s defeat of Nelson Rockefeller
and Scranton put the Cowboys in control of both major
parties.</p>
<p>The Texas Cowboys, as Ralph Fucetola of N.J. has
pointed out to me, are the most established, socially
acceptable Cowboys. So the Yankees joined forces with
them, using their Media-University-Bureaucracy Complex
 (MUBC) to crush Goldwater.</p>
<p>This is the place to recall the FDR use of ideology
 to topple his opponents (also, Roosevelt’s running
 mate in 1932 &amp; 1936. Cactus Jack Garner, was
archetypically Cowboy). It brought about a near-coup
by Morgan-DuPont interests, who backed a fascist plot
(See “The Cellophane Conspiracy,” by David Rosinger
in NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES #28). Franklin aborted the
move and mended his fences with his backers.</p>
<p>Goldwater’s major sin was an appeal to ideology.
As was often explicitly stated in the “intellectual”
attacks on him in 1964, Goldwater was unleashing “radicals”
 who would overturn the existing social order—the
 same sin the Morganites accused FDR of in 1934.</p>
<p>The ousting of Dean.Burch as GOP national chairman,
 ending Goldwaterite control of the party machinery,
put the Rockefeller Yankees back in control of the
Republicans. In 1968 the humbled Cowboys accepted
Yankee Spiro Agnew as running mate for tame Cowboy
Nixon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Yankees went after Johnson and
dumped him for Yankees HHH and Ed Muskie. Morgan
interests, as usual, Opposed Pacific Front imperialism
while supporting NATO-European interventionism. Rockefeller
 interests were pro-Pacific Front (hence Nelson’s
support of the Indochina war down the line), but anti-Johnson
 Cowboy domestic control.</p>
<p>Nixon’s victory in 1968 led to immediate attack
by the Trustbusters on Ling-Temco-Vought, a major Texas
Cowboy conglomerate. However, the Southwestern (Haldeman
 and Ehrlichman) and Florida (Rebozo) Cowboys rode
high in the first Nixon administration.</p>
<p>McGovern’s victory in the 1972 Democratic convention
 veered the party too far to the “radical” (which,
to the Establishment, means “those-who-threaten-our-rule”
 and is applied to left, right, and libertarian
regardless of other views). The most liberal Morganites
hung on with Sargent Shriver’s replacement of Tom
Eagleton, but others defected.</p>
<p>Once again, after crushing defeat of semi-radical
candidates, Yankees sabotaged a Cowboy president. Using
local political payoff records and tax dodging
which are usually forgotten when a politico moves
up to a higher office, the MUBC actually drove out
Agnew and replaced him with Rockefeller Yankee
Gerald Ford (Agnew himself was originally a Rockefeller
 Yankee but was acquiring a new Cowboy base).
The remarkableness of this feat is not that they
managed to find and publicize Such records and evidence
 but that the MUBC Suppressed all the available
counter-revelations which existed for every other
politician.</p>
<p>Whether or not Watergate was in fact set up by
Yankee agents to entrap Cowboy operatives is really
irrelevant, though interesting. Such activities are
always going on, and again, it was the revelation
and constant hammering away at the Cowboys’ culpability
 and the Suppression of Yankee malfeasance
which is the notable achievement of the MUBC.
Bringing Nixon to the point of impeachment was the
greatest exhibition of Yankee power, and contrasted
with the Cowboy crudity of relying on assassination.</p>
<p>At the point that this article is written, the
Yankees are about to confirm Rockefeller as vice
president. With David Rockefeller running the financial
 system of the U.S. and much of the world,
and Nelson as president (after Ford’s predictable
removal) and commander in chief, separation of power
ends in the United States.</p>
<p>The Cowboys are on the run. Howard Hughes,
who controlled Nevada Republicans through Governor
Laxalt, was driven out of the state and out of the
country. Texas oil is threatened by throttling of
oil depletion allowances (acceptable to the entrenched
 Eastern “old money” oil interests); The
Space Program cancellation broke several Cowboy companies
 and Lockheed is on the dole. H.L. Hunt is
dead, his Libya venture seized by a coup.</p>
<p>Still, George Wallace is alive thought not
kicking, and he remains a Cowboy hope for second
spot. And Boeing’s Senator, Scoop Jackson, has a
coalition with organized labour.</p>
<p>The Cowboys are also considering a Reagan/Buckley
 third party.</p>
<p>For the first time in U.S. history since 1864,
the question of whether or not there will be future
elections becomes debatable. In fact, the scenarios
to Step the Rockefeller Yankee power consolidation
seem more “far out” than the takeover.</p>
<p>One scenario is a Libertarian Party/Reagan Republican/Wallacite-Bircher
 coalition (exactly analogous
 to the Free Soil Party/Abolitionist Whigs/American Party
 coalition that formed the GOP in
1856) for a radical/Cowboy attack on the Yankees.</p>
<p>With Kennedy’s withdrawal, the Morgans seem
strangely quiescent and willing to let the Rockefellers
 run the Yankee show. If the Democrats put
up a Jackson/Wallace ticket, it will either be bought
out (Jackson at least seems purchasable) or crushed
by the MUBC. Or will it? Can even Such a huge propaganda
 syndicate overwhelm the average American’s
innate distrust of the Rockefellers? The present
indications are that around 80% of the country opposes
 the Rockefeller takeover. So will Rocky
allow an election in 1976, after, as I believe:
he ousts Ford?</p>
<p>The answer will be, if he thinks he can win,
there Will be an election. If David Rockefeller
estimates that cancelling the Constitution would
incite the populace to back radicals, he will force
Nelson to face election.</p>
<p>Who would oppose him? Jackson/Wallace would
be a Cowboy ticket. On the other hand, another
McGovern-type semi-radical would split the Democrats
and probably win it for Rocky. A Democrat Split
also gives a Reagan Conservative Cowboy group a
chance.</p>
<p>If you are wondering who is in ascendancy at a
given time, observe what industries are getting
govt. contracts, Subsidies, quotas, and tariffs.
Who is “Out”? The interests losing govt. contracts,
being trustbusted, receiving bad press, or attacked
as “threats to the ecology.”</p>
<p>Read the newspapers and newsmagazines, and work
out the games the “higher circles” are playing.</p>
<p>Libertarian economic and moral theory are necessary
 to understand the option of a free society,
and revisionism is necessary to understand the
nature of the state, its class support, and its
mechanics. To complete the integrated outlook, a
rounded libertarian must apply his morality, economics,
 revisionist history, and.other fields to
a goal-directed strategy. But that’s another
article!</p>
