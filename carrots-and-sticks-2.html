            <h4>Samuel E. Konkin, 3rd</h4>
<h2>Carrots And Sticks 2</h2>
<p>In the last issue of SLR, Your Friendly
Neighborhood Anarcho-columnist decided to toss
some carrots of praise to neglected W. Coast
libertarians and to rest the stick with which
he beats various deviationists. But the coastal
regions of the U.S. have received more than
enough good press coverage. Let YFNA’s roving
eye cast itself on Middle America, that paradise
 promised us by the Prophet Murray, the
Profit Incarnate.</p>
<p>Colorado, of course, was gifted (or cursed,
as you will) with the Nolans. But how many of
my friendly neighborhood anarcho-readers know
that one of the truly great libertarians of all
time still lives high up in the mountains?</p>
<p>James J. Martin was a hard-core Stirnerist-type
 free market anarchist back in the dim,
dark days of World War II. He fought the draft
and the war with brilliant revisionist history
from the beginning. Martin’s REVISIONIST VIEWPOINTS
 contains essays from the old RAMPART
JOURNAL of Robert LeFevre that are still pace-setters
 in libertarian historiography. Recently
Jim appeared at a libertarian conference which
ran concurrently with the ill-scarred Dallas LP
convention. He may yet return to liven up the
pages of the journals of the modern Movement.</p>
<p>Up north, in Illinois, Joe Cobb prowls. I
have much quarrel with Joe’s present Partyarchist
 actions, but in the sixties he put out a
great little journal called the NEW INDIVIDUALIST
REVIEW: A Journal of Classical Liberal Thought.
In it Murray took cudgel to minarchists, and
Austrians battled with Friedmanites. Joe’s
own chapter of the Radical Libertarian Alliance
was humorous, though perhaps unintentionally,
since he worked for an alliance with ACLU-liberals
 while the rest of the RLA was trying
to embrace the New Left. Whatever degradation
Joe slips into these days, his fame and value
has already been vouchsafed by history, which
is more than the rest of us can safely assert
about ourselves.</p>
<h3>In Barry’s Back Yard</h3>
<p>Arizona was the home of the original Student
Libertarian Action Movement, once described by
this writer as the “Weathermen” of the libertarian
 movement. SLAM’s classic battle with the
police on the U of A campus won them accolades
and collections for a defense fund around the
country. Alas, SLAM is gone, after a brief split
into SLAM and “North American Libertarian Alliance,”
though Fred Woodworth and Conrad Goeringer have
gotten together in the modern MATCH! to got their
left-deviationist way.</p>
<p>Ralph Kerner brought the Libertarian Caucus
home from the ’69 YAF-con in St. Louis to La.,
and he and Evan Soule have been fueling the flame
of freedom there ever since. Evan went on to
create the Committee to Legalize Cold, a strange
animal in the libertarian bestiary of front groups.
After all, it actually succeeded in achieving its
goal!</p>
<p>The Lone Star State once boasted Scott
Tips and Mike Holmes, with their HARD CORE NEWS.
“Hard Core” is still the highest exclamation of
approval in the Movement, and the famous Hard
Core sweatshirt is a rare collector’s item.</p>
<p>Mike Holmes has since sunk into Partyac, and
Scott has Browned out and moved to Southern California,
 but their legacy remains. Over at
Sul Ross State College, Tony Warnock teaches
“logic,” his name for the basic libertarian principles.
 Tony was once at the U. of Wis. with
YFNA, and gave Free University classes in Praxeology
 while YFNA roused the rabble a bit more
crudely.</p>
<p>Still in Wis. is Don McKowen, trying to liberate
 minds in Milwaukee, a truly Herculean
task. Many a libertarian leaflet has been passed
to the unsuspecting masses by Don, and many of the
Rationalist Church of America objectivists have
been shaken out of their views by his Stirnerism</p>
<h3>The Deep South Folks</h3>
<p>Recently Browned out in Georgia, but still
watching us with some interest, is David Rosinge
Dave’s original SOUTHERN LIBERTARIAN MESSENGER
was a brilliant Rothbardian beacon in a branch
of the Movement which once predominantly Randist
and Banneristi. Dave’s activism brought about
the first two Southern Libertarian Conferences,
the second of which featured YFNA routing Mike
Holmes and his attempt to get a libertarian part
going in the bayous and magnolia. Dave has also
been into revisionism, and the only ISOLATIONIST
pamphlet was written by him and printed in NLN
for the now defunct radical caucus.</p>
<p>Down at the south end of Alabama teaches a
university professor by the name of Steve Halbrook.
 “Crazy Steve” was one of the great deviationists
 of the Movement, and today’s heretics
 pale in comparison. Today I regard him wit
nostalgia, remembering his articles (like “Classical
 Utopianist Anarchism vs. Leninist Libertarianism,”
 and his urging us to consider Mao
a libertarian) as something a critic could really
sink his teeth into. While his Vanguard Party
thankfully never got off the ground, Steve was
instructive to us in showing how libertarians
should <em>not</em> go.</p>
<p>Not all Middle American libertarians have
faded into the Shadow World of Mundanity. Still
plugging away in Pa. is the Society for Individual
 Liberty of Don Ernsberger and Dave Walters.
While the coasts never did get into a SIL frame,
preferring libertarian alliances of a local nature,
 most of Middle America knew of other libertarians
 only through their SIL NEWS.</p>
<p>One neglected area of interest is Canada.
During the heyday of the Libertarian Alliance, a
group put out an occasional journal in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, called THE SKEPTIC. While the zine ha
faded out, it briefly gave hope for the expansic
of libertarianism into some of the more outflung
areas of the world. Currently, revival of activity
 in Ontario and Alberta gives us hope.</p>
<p>Many other bright comets soared across the
libertarian skies in the early seventies in the
Middle of the Heartland, and with the upcoming
collapse of the LP and its stifling influence
and rigid conformity to outworn institutions, we
can hope that a general renaissance is in the
offing.</p>
<p>(What about the E. Coast? For those readers who
are interested in YFNA’s views on that subject,
a quick subscription to NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES
will bring NLN 40 and “Farewell to the East,”
where that is well taken care of.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Contributors </p>
<p>Abby Goldsmith, another dropout from
state level LP leadership, has been active in
the Movement for many years in Conn. and Fla.
She is a regular contributor to such publications
 as NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES and SOUTHERN
LIBERTARIAN MESSENGER.</p>
<p>Samuel Edward Konkin, III, is the editor
of NEW LIBERTARIAN NOTES, the Movement’s most
outstanding monthly magazine. A doctoral
candidate in theoretical chemistry at NYU,
Konkin plans a move to the west Coast this
summer.</p>
<p>NOTE: NLN 40 wasn’t published until after (it was also NLW 88-89, the fifth all-sf ish) and contained no such material. But it might’ve been published somewhere else...</p>
