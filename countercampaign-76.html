            <h4>Samuel E. Konkin, 3rd</h4>
<h2>CounterCampaign ’76</h2>
<p>Last issue Your Friendly Neighborhood Anarchocolumnist
 (YFNA) sketched the last six years
of the Movement’s history again, this time focusing
 on strategy. The failure of all tactics
used until now, with the exception of the somewhat
 arduous Counter-Economic approach (hard
work and all that) was noted, and the Party heresy
 was pointed out as the most blatant failure.
But also noted was the drive for exhibition on
the part of many libertarians, a desire for visibility
 in a Public Campaign. Really, about
the only positive thing the Party ever claimed
for itself was that it attracted people by public
 campaigning (a false claim, by the way—the
Party has yet to <em>convert</em> one person that I know
of, usually getting its memberships from old
LAers, NBIers, and reader-converts).</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the problems involved
in a political campaign. First, the Party must
be a monopoly with individuals subjecting themselves
 to compromise or outright sell-out to
unite behind a candidate. Why? To get him a
chance of winning. Why? To take office, of
course.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the next problem. A libertarian
 in office is another politician with
power to oppress us. Either he has the power
and refrains from using it (threatens us) or
uses it (coerces us). Nobody can be trusted
with that, clearly.</p>
<p>And who could we all agree on without sacrificing
 our principles? Behind whom could
students of Murray Rothbard, Robert LeFevre,
Ayn Rand, Leonard Read, Joseph Galambos, Karl
Hess, Robert A. Heinlein, El Rayo, Natallee
Hall, and Harry Browne unite? Nobody.</p>
<p>Finally, what candidate can libertarians
even draw from our ranks with enough popular
appeal to bring large numbers into his campaign
that we could then use all our libertarian
wiles on to radicalize? Nobody again.</p>
<p>Look at the 1974 election for Republicans,
Democrats, American Independents, and Peace &amp;
Freedomers. 62% (5 out of 8, figure counters)
voted for Nobody. Clearly, she is the most
popular candidate, the favourite for 1976.</p>
<p>Who? Why, Nobody, of course.</p>
<p>Look at her advantages! (I cannot refer
to Nobody as her, actually, since it is not
true that Nobody is female; but it is also
false that Nobody is male. So as courtesy to
feminists, I use the feminine. After all, who
cares if Nobody is offended?)</p>
<p>Nobody would give up her power if elected.
Nobody is free from being a focus for factional
strife. Nobody already commands large support
from the people. (Witness NLA’s brief Vote for
Nobody campaign and Sy Leon’s previous League
of Non-Voters activities for instruction in
great publicity at next to no cost.)</p>
<p>Considering the seriousness of the Office
of the President, Nobody would stand for a
whimsical, witty campaign to woo the wary.</p>
<p>Nobody would fail to seduce the new converts
 into Statism. And Nobody would fail
to have yet another “cult of personality”
spring around her. Blacks and rednecks, feminists
 and male chauvinists, the poor and
the wealthy, the fannish and the sercon,
ex-liberals and ex-conservatives could all
identify at once with Nobody. Who else can
make that claim?</p>
<p>And, speaking of the campaign, I can see
it now. “Nobody in Congress was against
Taxes in ’76. Vote for Nobody!” (Great
around April 15.) “Nobody can represent
your interests in government. Nobody for
President!” “Nobody deserves to live off
your hard-earned tax money. Nobody’s our
Man!” (Or woman, person, sentient, thing...)</p>
<p>And remember, dear reader, Nobody can
hold more than one office in the U.S. Nobody
 for Congress! Nobody for Senate! Nobody
 for mayor! Nobody for governor! Nobody
 for dog-catcher...whoops, almost forgot
 about the limited governmentalists.</p>
<p>Before I get carried away (yeah!) with
the whimsy, such a campaign is kicking off
this year in several stages. On July 4,
Counter-campaign ’76 will be announced to
the libertarian movement. Want a franchise
in your area? After all, even if we have
a State Committee in your area, you could
always set up a Congressional District Committee,
 county committee, assembly district
committee, or whatever. There’s plenty
for everyone. All the National Committee
asks is that if you re-publish <em>our</em> ads in
publications we haven’t covered (or put
our your own handbills), split the take
with us 50-50. Otherwise we will send you
a “letter of authorization” for you to
show to local statists with no hassle.</p>
<p>Get fast, fast relief from political
anxiety. Nobody can’t sell out! Countercampaign
 ’76 may even have a National Nominating
 Convention in 1976. Best place would
be in Kansas City the week before Labour
Day. Some 10,000 SF fen are expected to
be at the Hotel Muehlebach to hear the
Worldcon guest of honor—Robert Heinlein.
Libertarians and sympathizers will be
highly concentrated there anyway.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chairperson, the State of Virginia
unanimously nominates Nobody for President!”
Cheers, balloons, kick lines. (Feminists
may have male kick lines, if they wish. Nobody
 won’t mind.)</p>
<p>Naturally, delegate credentials will
be <em>sold,</em> blatantly. (Sounds like the regular
 conventions to me—Ed.) After all, Nobody
 is free from corruption. And this being
 the era of Watergate, nobody is free
from scandal and smear!</p>
<p>There you are, hard-core person. The
problem I posed at the beginning of this column
 is solved. After all, I could not just
carp and criticize without having a positive
plan of action. Nobody would expect that
from me! And remember, you can vote for Nobody
 in the convenience of your own home.
(Send your name and address to the editor of
this publication if you are interested in
either campaigning for Nobody or/and wish
to be a delegate.)</p>
